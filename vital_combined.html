The emphasis in the last sentence is on the word process. Growth is a natural process that is occurring all the time, all around us. People grow, companies grow, nations grow too. This growth usually occurs in response to some fortuitous opportunity in the environment or it is compelled by the pressure of external conditions. But these are only stimuli that initiate the process, not the process itself. The process of growth is an internal mechanism in all living organisms and is propelled by its own energies. In companies that process is initiated and directed by management. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">Companies are growing all the time without ever fully understanding how or why that growth takes place. In other words, the process of growth is usually unconscious or at best semiconscious. But occasionally there are individuals, like Tom Watson at IBM or Fred Smith at Federal Express, who have acquired a deeper understanding of the process and have utilized it to vastly accelerate the growth and multiply the profits of their companies. This knowledge and productive power are available for all who seek to acquire it. It is a knowledge that individuals can discover for themselves by observing and understanding the process as it expresses in their own lives and their own companies. Those who acquire knowledge of the process have the capacity to achieve extraordinary results in business. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">We live in a country that has grown phenomenally over the last two centuries to become the most prosperous nation in the world. Our growth has been swift, spontaneous and exponential. So much so that we have not had the time or inclination to stop and reflect on the process by which we achieved it. Today this nation is beset with problems--a burgeoning national debt, an enormous trade deficit, a simultaneous mixture of unemployment among low income groups and lack of skilled people for higher paying jobs, and the everpresent spectre of inflation. As a nation we lack the same knowledge that most companies lack, the knowledge of the process of growth that made the nation great and possesses the power to make it far greater still, if only we fully utilize the country&#39;s and our own potentials. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">In a real sense, individuals who discover the process of growth and accelerate the growth of their own businesses do a real service to the nation. They are the pioneers who show us what is possible and blaze a trail for others to follow. This book is intended for the trail blazers, who in growing their own companies, serve the nation and help it grow. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">The book can be read at three levels: theory, example and practice. It presents the basic principles of the process of corporate growth. These principles are illustrated by inspiring examples of companies of all sizes and descriptions drawn from a wide range of industries, which have utilized the process to grow very rapidly and double or triple their profits in a short time. For those who are practicing managers, the book also contains a number of specific strategies for applying the principles in your own company or department and a series of detailed exercises to assist in making the ideas and their application as real and relevant to your company as possible. These strategies and exercises have been tested and proven extremely effective in our work with a wide range of companies. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">&quot;I set the limits on my growth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">Terry Crabbe, Sound Hounds</span></p><p class="c11 c2" id="h.gem8irvvuqe6"><span class="c18 c6 c25 c8"></span></p><h1 class="c21"><span class="c1 c25">Chapter 1 </span><span class="c1">THE CHALLENGE</span></h1><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 575.93px; height: 283.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 575.93px; height: 283.47px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What do all the companies in this list have in common? Each of these companies reported profits last year at least twice as large as their profits the year before-in some cases as much as five or ten times larger. A few of them also doubled their revenues last year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What distinguishes these companies from one another? Just about everything else. They come from all parts of the U.S.A., a complete mix of manufacturing and service businesses, hi-tech and low tech, old and young, very large ($20 billion) to very small ($1.1 million).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We could probably fill a whole book with the names of companies that doubled their profits or revenues last year. Would the name of your company be on our list? If not, why not? If yes, will it be on next year&#39;s Double It list too? That is the subject of this book.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Howard K. Cooper. President and CEO of Trimedyne, a Los Angeles based hi-tech medical equipment manufacturer, is obsessed with these questions. His company more than doubled last year. Revenues grew from $12 million in 1987 to $31 million in 1988, while pretax profits increased from $500,000 to $6.5 million. For him, the challenge has been: &quot;How to introduce my people to the concept of 2X, meaning twice again next year. Some guys would be happy to do $12 million again. But we (top management) won&#39;t be and neither will the shareholders.&quot; What about you?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The whole thing is not really about numbers. Doubling is only a figure of speech. The real issue is about being the very best possible, achieving the maximum possible for your business. For some, doing the maximum possible may be tripling revenues in one year like Palma Tool &amp; Die in Buffalo, which went from $400,000 to $1.2 million in 1987, or tripling profits in one year like Eastman Kodak, whose earnings soared from $374 million to $1.2 billion in 1987. Or more.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Over the last few years we have observed young companies emerging from obscurity to take old established industries by storm, like P.A.M. Transport, a trucking company started in 1980 with 5 trucks and 15 trailers and now one of the ten largest irregular truckers in the country with over 700 trucks and 1,500 trailers. We have also seen established companies suddenly awaken from slumber and soar into prominence like Patten Corporation, a real estate company founded in 1965, whose revenues grew to $4.3 million over its first fifteen years and then rocketed between 1984 and 1988 to $116 million with profits of $15 million. Along with everyone else we have watched mega-corporations amble on for years with flat sales or slow steady growth and then surge forward dramatically like Ford Motors, which lost billions of dollars in the early 1980s then bounced back to raise revenues by 80% and more than double net income between 1985 and 1988.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Numbers do not tell the whole story. They are only an indicator, an expression of something going on deeper within these companies. Doubling is as much a question of quality as of quantity. This book is about raising the quality of corporate performance from that of an average or above-average performer to become the very best. The question, as Trimedyne&#39;s Cooper put it, is &quot;Even in the professional ranks, what makes the difference between just an ordinary player, a professional player and the champion?&quot; We may measure that difference quantitatively in terms of seconds clocked, yards run, points scored, or games won. But being a champion is essentially a question of quality.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE MYSTIQUE OF RAPID GROWTH</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Over the last few years we have studied and surveyed more than 1,000 companies around the world from North America to South India and back-companies ranging in size from a few hundred thousand dollars to tens of billions, companies in a wide spectrum of businesses from basic manufacturing-the tools, dies and molds used to make just about everything else-to ice cream, toothpaste, stereos and integrated circuits, from down-to-earth, traditional services like selling land, remodelling homes, transporting cargo and repairing shoes to sophisticated, high-tech businesses in the finance and information industries.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These companies differ widely in age, size, origin, geography and culture. They also share a lot in common with each other and with other companies in terms of the way they were founded, the types of experiences they have had, and the challenges and problems they have confronted. But the most significant common denominator which links them all together is that they have grown rapidly and profitably; and even more importantly, they have managed to maintain high rates of profitable growth over a considerable period of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Growth is a refreshing and invigorating experience, and there is something particularly exciting and exhilarating about rapid corporate growth. Growth is both a natural and universal phenomenon common to all living things. Therefore it is doubly strange that corporate growth should be the subject of so many superstitions and misconceptions. Few issues are so frequently discussed these days and yet so steeped in mystery as the phenomenon of rapid corporate growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we talk of rapid growth, companies like Apple Computers, Federal Express, The Limited, Circuit City may come to mind. But there are many others-thousands of companies of all sizes and descriptions and in every conceivable type of business that are experiencing rapid growth at this very moment. In fact there is nothing very uncommon about rapid growth at all, except perhaps that we think there is. And that is a very important &quot;perhaps&quot;, because it often prevents companies from growing as fast and as far as they can. The myths and superstitions surrounding corporate growth would not be so important, if they did not have such a profound impact on the performance of most companies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How would you react if someone walked into your company and said that you can double your revenues or profits within 24 months? Skeptical? Suspicious? Amused? Probably not unlike Ray Kennedy, CEO of Kennedy &amp; Bowden Machine Co. in Nashville, TN who commented: &quot;The first time I heard the idea, I thought it was pure hype!&quot; In the last one year, Kennedy&#39;s profits have increased by more than 50%. His initial reaction only illustrates how unusual rapid growth seems, despite the fact that it is happening all the time, all around us and, not uncommonly, to us as well-for virtually every company has grown rapidly at one time or another.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then why all the mystery? The mystique of rapid growth is reinforced by a host of myths and superstitions that prompt us to admire rather than imitate the accomplishments of other companies and to dream of greater success rather than striving to achieve it. This corporate lore is supported by a vast array of common sense, conventional wisdom and objective fact. But that does not make it inevitably true or compelling. The real issue is not whether it is ever true, but whether it need be true for your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to quantify the potentials which we believe exist for every company, we speak in terms of doubling revenues or profits within a year or two. Such a goal may seem unrealistic to some and modest to others. But in either case, the real challenge we propose is to go beyond the ordinary and unexceptional to attain the highest possible and achievable. Our experience has convinced us that the highest possible is almost always far more than what even the most dynamic and ambitious companies attempt to achieve.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is so because, while a great many companies experience rapid growth, very few really understand how to consciously tap and systematically utilize the sources of energy that drive and propel it. But before coming to that, the first necessity is to dispel the myths that conceal the underlying process.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE FIVE MYTHS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myth #1: There are inherent limits to how fast companies can grow:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Of course there are limits. The question is: How fast is fast? When &quot;reasonable&quot; companies plan for rapid growth, they think in terms of 15%, 20% or at best 30%. But much higher rates of growth are being achieved by many companies. According to INC. Magazine, the 100 fastest growing public U.S. companies in 1987 grew at a compound annual rate ranging from 93% to 579% between 1982 and 1986. The 612 companies which have appeared on the INC. 100 since 1979 have grown at an average compound rate of 90%, doubling in size on average every 56 weeks.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Such high rates of growth are certainly impressive, but they immediately raise two other dominant myths about rapid growth: growth of this magnitude can only be achieved from a very small base and in newly emerging industries.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myth #2: Opportunities for rapid growth exist only in new, non-traditional or high-tech industries, which are not yet dominated by giants: </span><span class="c3">If Fred Smith had believed this generalization, he never would have started Federal Express and entered the parcel delivery business, which had been dominated by the Postal Service and UPS for nearly a century.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is true that many fast growing companies come from high-tech industries. But this generalization conceals the fact that a great many others do not-companies like Century 21 (real estate), Kinder Care (day care), Liz Claiborne (garments) and Nike (shoes). In fact the top three companies on INC.&#39;s 1988 list are specialty discounters-Entertainment Marketing, Home Shopping Network and Warehouse Club. INC.&#39;s top ten for 1988 also included Care Plus (home health-care services), Sahlen &amp; Associates (security services) and Vipont Pharmaceuticals (oral hygiene products).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is nothing very high-tech or non-traditional about vinyl siding. AMRE, Inc. began doing custom home installation of external siding in 1980. In 1983 the company had revenues of $4.4 million. By 1986 it had grown nine-fold to $40 million. Sales doubled in 1987 to $78 million and nearly doubled again to $140 million last year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The Biggest Firm in Town:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Other very fast growing companies can be found in unlikely industries and unusual places too. Tontitown, Arkansas is not exactly a thriving metropolis, but being the largest company in this small town is none-the-less a considerable distinction-even if the town has a population of less than 700. In 1980 Paul Maestri founded P.A.M. Transport in his home town under a large oak tree with $3,000 in capital. The company has doubled in size every year since it was established. Today P.A.M. is a $75.8 million company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myth #3: The bigger you are, the slower you grow:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;True enough, most of the companies on the INC. list were under $10 million in size when they went public. But a number have already crossed the $100 million or the $500 million mark and are still going places-companies like Liz Claiborne, whose sales rose from $117 million to $1 billion between 1982 and 1987 (a five-year growth rate of 47% compared to the industry&#39;s 8%) while profits increased from $10 million to $114 million.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Still one could argue that a few hundred million dollars is relatively small. What about the big guys? In 1970 IBM had revenues of $7.2 billion. Over the past 17 years, it has grown another eight-fold to $54 billion. The revenues of Federal Express nearly doubled between 1984 and 1986 growing from $1.4 billion to $2.6 billion. In the last two years revenues have risen another 80% to over $4 billion. Of course, Federal Express knows that it cannot keep growing at that rate indefinitely. That is why it has set only a modest growth target for the rest of the century-to become the largest transportation company in the world! Companies like Federal Express and IBM are exceptional, but hardly unique. Other major corporations like Apple, Coca-Cola and Marriott also have targets to at least double in size over the next few years. What about your company?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But after all, anyone can increase revenues simply by lowering prices and cutting profits-which brings us to the fourth myth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myth #4: The larger you grow, the smaller your margin of profit:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Let us concede from the beginning that this is certainly most often the case. The question is whether the fact is the result of the myth or vice verse? Bajaj Auto Ltd. has dominated the Indian motor scooter industry for nearly 30 years. The company grew from $1 million in 1961 to $36 million in 1976. Over the next decade sales grew another ten-fold and pretax profits rose nine-fold. In 1986 sales rose 60% to $420 million and operating profit increased a staggering 72% to $100 million. But by this time the Indian market had begun to really heat up with the entry of more than 30 new competitors including the world&#39;s largest players-Honda (world #1), Suzuki and Piaggio (Vespa). In 1987 Bajaj&#39;s revenues crossed $500 million, after tax profits doubled, and the company now ranks second in the world in its industry with plans to double production again by 1992.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sterling Chemicals of Houston is a company that shatters all the myths. This fledgling three year old created from Monsanto&#39;s petrochemical manufacturing facilities recorded sales of $699 million in 1988 with profits of $213 million and a return on equity of 235%!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Myth #5: Rapid growth cannot last:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;We come finally to the most devastating of the myths about rapid growth, most devastating because it is most often true. Almost every company grows rapidly at some points in its existence, but in most cases spurts of rapid growth tend to be just that, short-lived bursts followed by leveling off and in some cases decline or extinction. Rapid growth is not only very common. It is usually very fleeting too. Rapid growth is not only exhilarating. It is also extremely demanding and sometimes fatal. Some companies actually grow themselves right out of existence.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">We can, of course, quote exceptions to this rule like Apple Computer, whose sales climbed from $1 million in 1977 to $335 million in 1982, then rose to $2.67 billion in 1987, while profits multiplied 5.5 times to $218 million. In 1988 sales grew another 54% to $4.1 billion and profits nearly doubled again to $400 million. But the fact remains that rapid growth is for the most part a transient phenomena. Nearly 40% of the companies that appeared on INC.&#39;s 1987 list did not return in 1988.</span><a id="id.rkzwnnec493k"></a><span class="c8">&nbsp;In a survey of 770 U.S. corporations which we conducted in collaboration with American Management Association, periods of rapid growth lasted an average of 29 months.</span><span class="c15 c17">1</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet still we refer to this frequently documented occurrence as a myth, not only because it is not always true, but also because it need not be true for any company that fully understands the process of growth and anticipates its demands.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Greatest Myth of All:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;These five generalizations obviously cannot serve as guidelines for a company that wants to grow and keep growing rapidly and profitably. Shattering their hold on us is the first step toward rapid growth. Even when we give up one myth, we frequently adopt another in its place. Very often even when we say and genuinely believe we are free from them, they guide our every action-the plans we make, the type and number of people we recruit, the size of the computer we buy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How much do you plan to increase sales or profits next month? Next quarter? Next year? Are you hiring people who can help take the company to a far higher level and continue to grow with it? Are you equipping them with all the skills they will need to manage that growth? Are you putting in systems capable of handling a much greater volume of work in future? Or do you say: &quot;Let the growth happen and then I will do all these things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">What we should part with is The Myth of Limits.&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The only really binding limitations on our growth are the constraints placed on us by our limited perception of what is possible and our limited aspiration to achieve it.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Terry Crabbe, founder of Sound Hounds in Victoria. B.C. put it succinctly: &quot;I set the limits on my growth!&quot; Or as Lee Southard, President of Vipont Research, expressed it; &quot;You can be whatever you resolve to be. Everything is possible!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THREE CONCLUSIONS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our study of rapidly growing companies has led us to three fundamental conclusions:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Our first conclusion is that rapid, sustained and profitable growth is possible for any company that really wants it and is willing for the effort. The emphasis is on wants and willing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But doesn&#39;t everyone want to grow rapidly and profitably and keep on growing? Not by a long shot! Sure, almost all companies will welcome growth if it comes their way. But that is not enough. Few companies really, genuinely believe that rapid and continuous growth is possible for them, and even fewer are willing for the effort needed to achieve and sustain it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">So everything comes down to the questions: Do I really believe that rapid growth is possible? Do I really want it? This book is intended to help the reader answer the first of these questions in the affirmative.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But the second question-Do I really want it?-we each must answer for ourselves. Actually the two questions are much more closely interlinked than may at first seem evident. For very often our lack of understanding or appreciation of a possibility is actually an expression of a lack of aspiration or an unwillingness to take the effort needed to achieve it. To put it plainly, when we say we do not understand or do not believe, we really mean we do not care or are not willing to try.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many companies today cannot really afford the luxury of choosing between rapid and more moderate rates of growth. Our society is changing so rapidly that companies which do not seek to perform at their maximum, may not even survive-as Chrysler almost did not survive. Dave Norman, co-founder of Businessland, put it bluntly: &quot;If you don&#39;t grow, you&#39;ll die.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Our second conclusion is that rapid growth in revenues and profits is the result of a process, a process that can be learned. Many entrepreneurs may be born with innate talents for enterprise, but the knowledge and skills needed to grow and keep growing a company can be acquired by anyone.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the remaining chapters of this book, we attempt to describe that process and to illustrate how it works in companies of all sizes drawn from a wide range of industries. This process is not something we have invented. It is the natural process by which all companies grow, but usually that process is unconscious. How many companies really understand what has propelled their growth up to the present? How many ever even ask the question? In our experience very few, even among the most successful.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Usually growth occurs unconsciously in response to the pressure of external forces or as the result of favorable circumstances, such as an expansive market or a new technology. Companies respond to these conditions by releasing their energies and tapping inner potentials which have been there all the time unutilized or underutilized beneath the surface, just as psychologists say that the average man utilizes less than 10% of his mental capacities during normal life. This need not be true either for the individual or the company. If we become fully conscious of the process by which we have grown up to the present, we acquire the ability to stimulate and accelerate that process in the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every company has already doubled in quality and quantity many times. What most of us understand as the result of luck or hard work is an expression of a process we do not perceive. Normally we think doubling is possible only if luck is on our side-if the market suddenly takes off or if we discover a great new product or if someone offers to double the investment in our company. Doubling is possible without waiting for such fortuitous circumstances to occur by fully utilizing the potentials which lie within every company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Our third conclusion is that the process of growth is fundamentally the same for the individual, the company, and the nation. In fact the three are inextricably intertwined, i.e. personal growth, corporate growth and national growth go together.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Companies which strive for the maximum personal growth of their people tend to grow the fastest and the farthest. So too, individuals who strive to fully release their personal energies and fully utilize their capacities for the growth of the companies they work for tend to grow the most as well, both in terms of career advancement and development of personality.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DOUBLE AMERICA</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The same is true of the nation.</span><a id="id.sh8nlz17hmz1"></a><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The New York Times&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">recently published an editorial entitled &quot;Two Trillion Dollars Is Missing&quot;, in which it mourned the declining rate of growth in industrial productivity and concluded:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&quot;By world standards, the American economy remains a continuing success. By the standards of what America might achieve</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;if its creative energies were fully utilized, it is only stumbling along. No one knows how to excite and harness those energies.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;But the stakes, from maintaining national security to rescuing poor children, are immense. The rejuvenation of the incredible productivity machine stands as the highest priority of America&#39;s new political era.&quot;</span><span class="c15 c17">2</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Obviously we must first understand how to fully release and harness our own creative energies and those of the people we work with and the companies that constitute this great national economy. In the last two hundred years the quantity and the quality of American life have doubled many times-in terms of productivity, national wealth, educational attainments, scientific knowledge, technological development, etc. How far have we as a nation really understood the secrets of our own success, the source of the enormous creative energies that have propelled our growth and the process by which we have released and harnessed those energies to double our achievements time and again?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the world of today, the time required for doubling is shorter than ever before-as the rapid emergence to power of countries on the Pacific Rim makes abundantly clear. Yet as the Times article reminds us, our own rate of growth is declining, while that of others around us continues to accelerate. Between 1948 and 1965, output per hour in the U.S. rose 3% per year. Had it continued to grow at the 1965 rate, our gross national product today would be $2 trillion higher than it actually is and per capita income would be 40% higher than it is now. That additional national income would generate enough tax revenues to completely eradicate the federal budget deficit.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Is that decline inevitable? Certainly not. Like today&#39;s developing countries, our rapid growth in the past was fueled by tremendous gains in productivity based on the spread of education and the application of advanced technologies. Have we exhausted or even begun to exhaust the potentials of these two engines of growth? All recent studies of our educational system state emphatically that a doubling of the quality and quantity of our educational attainments is not only possible but essential for the future strength of the nation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The same is true of technology. The American farmer is regarded as among the most advanced in the world. Yet according to agriculture scientists, only 50% of the proven technological discoveries made in our nation&#39;s laboratories are utilized to enhance commercial production on our farms. How much more potential lies unutilized for applying advanced industrial technology in the hundreds of thousands of factories across the country?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nor are education and technology our only underutilized resources. There is a technology of organization, what is commonly call management, that we are only just beginning to understand and have hardly begun to utilize, a resource which can contribute as much to national productivity in the century that is soon to begin as scientific technology has in the one that is coming to a close.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The challenge to Double It is not intended just for companies. It is addressed to every individual reader and to the nation as well-to raise performance and productivity to the maximum level we are capable of-to double the prosperity and quality of life in America. If a continuation of past growth rates in productivity would be sufficient to eradicate the federal deficit, one of our most pressing national problems, how much more prosperous could our nation be, if we try to improve upon our past performance rather than merely trying to match it?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The idea of doubling America is not mere speculation. It is already happening. In 1988 alone American exports rose by 26%, the trade deficit declined by 21% and the profits of the nation&#39;s 500 largest industrial corporations rose by $115 billion or 27%-at which rate they would double in three years! What then can we not achieve by a concerted effort to fully utilize all our resources and fully tap all our potentials?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PROFIT PLANNING FOR PRACTICING MANAGERS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This book has been designed to assist practicing managers to apply the ideas it contains directly to their companies/divisions/departments to accelerate the growth of their businesses and dramatically increase profitability. If you complete all the exercises suggested in the book, you will have created a detailed plan to achieve maximum growth and profits for your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As you read through the concepts and examples in this book, practical, useful ideas may occur to you for application in your company. We encourage you to pause in your reading to note down ideas and decisions you take for the improvement of your business.

Survey of 770 U.S. Corporations conducted by Garry Jacobs and Frederick Harmon in collaboration with American Management Association.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0" id="h.p5lm5qve7tvu"><span class="c3">2. From an article in The New York Times dated January 8, 1989.</span></p><h1 class="c21"><span class="c1 c25">Chapter 2 ENGINES</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;OF GROWTH</span></h1><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c18 c6 c25 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the first chapter, we issued a challenge to all takers-double your performance. We also tried to raise and dispel some of the myths that block or slow growth. In spite of this, many of you might be thinking right now. &quot;Doubling may be possible for other companies, but... ours is a mature market... We have intense competition from Japan... Without a huge investment, we cannot grow... We cannot get the people we need...&quot; The reasons may vary, but the conclusion is the same. &quot;We are different.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If that is what you are thinking, then at least in this respect you have a lot in common with others. For most companies believe that their circumstances are somehow different than others-especially from companies that are more successful than they are.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How can we be so confident that doubling is possible for your company? Two reasons. The first is that we have seen companies in much more difficult circumstances than these-companies in the deepest trouble and on the verge of extinction-not only survive their ordeal but launch themselves on a fresh round of rapid and profitable growth. And so have you. Chrysler Corporation did it in the early 1980s at the very peak of the Japanese onslaught-hardly the right time or the right place for a comeback-after drawing down to their last $1 million in cash to meet daily expenses of $50 million. Chrysler not only survived, but has achieved record profits, doubled in size and increased its market share since then. Hundreds of mid-size and thousands of smaller companies have done it too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The second reason we are so confident about doubling is that, considering the unfathomed potentials that lie dormant within every company, doubling is a modest goal. Whatever your business, you possess five unlimited resources upon which to draw for growth, five engines, any one of which is powerful enough to double your revenues or-at the very least-your profits within a year or two.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These engines are nothing new. You do not have to buy them or install them. You already possess them. If you did not, your company could not exist, could not survive, could never grow. Think for a moment. What are the essential components needed for any business to exist, survive and grow, regardless of the industry?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The words we use to answer this question may vary as does the relative importance we place on one or another of the components. But whatever our method of classification, in order to be complete it must include five fundamental components:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">There must a need in society which the company serves, what is commonly called a&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">market.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;There must be also a&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">technology,</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;a know-how for producing a product or providing a service which the company offers to meet that market need. There must, of course, be&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">people</span><span class="c6 c8">-managers and workers who contribute their energies and ideas, talents and skills to deliver the products or services to meet the market need. There must also be</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;capital</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;in one form or another from one source or another to support and finance the activity. And finally there must be something which often seems vague and nebulous but which is absolutely indispensable in order to give life to the other four-there must be an&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization provides the structure and systems which direct the people and utilize the capital and technology to provide the products and services to meet the needs of the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The ancient philosophers spoke of the five cosmic elements from which all things in the universe are born and constituted-earth, water, air, fire and ether. The five engines are the creative forces from which all businesses are born and which give life to them. These five-market, technology, people, capital and organization - are all essential for the existence of any company. And they are more than that. They are not only the five basic elements out of which businesses are created. They are also powerful engines that can drive the growth of revenues and profits in every company. Each of these five is a vast reservoir of potential energy which can be released and utilized for higher sales and higher productivity. Drawing on the power of any one of them is enough to catapult a company into rapid growth. Drawing on the powers of all of them, even to a very limited extent, is enough to convert a near-fatal crisis into an opportunity for expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Everyone knows that an expansive market can be a powerful driving force for growth, that technology can propel a company upward, that capital is essential for increasing productive capacity, that good people and good organization are keys to success. Everyone knows that some companies are market driven, some are product driven and still others are people driven. So what?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">No matter how well we understand the importance of these five engines, no matter how seriously a company strives to exploit their powers, no matter how effectively you harness their potentials for growth, you can never exhaust their latent capacities. And if every reader, every company, knew and believed that and acted on that basis, they would already be doubling every year or two and our nation&#39;s $2 trillion shortfall in GNP would be a $2 trillion or perhaps a $10 trillion surplus. It is not as if the existence of these five engines is a secret from anyone. But the real depth and extent of their powers is as much a secret today as the energy pent up within the atom was to our ancestors in earlier centuries-unimagined and unutilized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think for a moment about your company or about a company you know well. Which of these five have been the engines that propelled its growth? How has the company harnessed their powers? How far has it really utilized their productive potentials? What more can be done to tap their capacities?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In later chapters we will explore many of the latent powers of each of these five and see how they can be applied in any business. For the moment let us contemplate a few of the miraculous feats they perform.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">A CHIP OFF AN OLD BLOCK</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Although most of the headlines are grabbed by the digital chips used as microprocessors and memory storage devices in computers, analog chips represents about 25% of the total market for integrated circuits. Analog chips electronically convert signals from real world parameters such as temperature.and pressure into digital language.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1981 three executives left the giant chip producer National Semiconductor to found a new company in Silicon Valley named Linear Technology, specializing in the manufacture of proprietary analog chips used in computers, defense and a wide variety of other electronic equipment. Since 1984 Linear&#39;s sales have soared nine-fold from $7 million to a current annual rate of $63 million with net profit margins in excess of 17%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear&#39;s phenomenal growth has been generated by tapping a few of the latent potentials of the engine market. Linear has energized its market by carefully attuning all its activities to meet the needs of its market and to deliver exactly what the customer wants. That is no short order in a business which involves 20 different manufacturing processes, which produces thousands of different products specifically designed to customer requirements, and in which the key to product development is the individual circuit designer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of the challenges for any company is to bridge the gap between what they make or offer to customers and what the customers really want. This may not be a serious problem for the owner of a small corner grocery store who is at once check-out clerk, purchasing agent and stock boy. But as soon as a company gets much larger or more complex than the corner store, a chasm begins to grow between what we think our customers want and what they actually want. We have seen many $1 million businesses in which the chasm had already widened into an unfathomable and sometimes fatal abyss. How does your company prevent a fissure from forming between it and the changing needs of its customers?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The dangers of producing what we know or like rather than what the customer really wants are especially great for technology-intensive companies like Linear, which are founded and managed by engineers and scientists. Yet Linear has discovered a way to bridge this gap and energize its market by means of a unique product development system. Each circuit designer goes out into the marketplace with the sales people to talk with customers and find out what they want. Then the same person comes back to the laboratory and designs a product to meet that need. The designer then moves with the product through the production phase and goes back into the field to meet customers again and ensure that the product works as it was intended. When customers call in with questions or complaints, they can speak to the expert who actually designed the product, not to a customer service representative. With a base of 4,000 customers, that says a lot about the company&#39;s commitment to its customers. &quot;I look at it as a triangle,&quot; says design director Tom Redfern. &quot;There is a customer, the manufacturing and a designer. It is very important for the design guy to be plugged into the customer.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear&#39;s CEO, Robert Swanson, commented, &quot;We go to great lengths to distill the information coming in from the field so what we design fills the real need.&quot; The result is a phenomenally high percentage of Linear&#39;s products are successful in the marketplace. Almost no product is a failure and some are very big success stories. For a technology-intensive business, Linear has shown that tapping even a single cylinder of the engine market can be a powerful lever for very rapid and very profitable growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">A FRESH PERSPECTIVE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">The energy that has fueled Linear&#39;s growth issues from an attitude, the attitude of looking at work from the customer&#39;s point of view. It may sound simple, but it is not-at least judging by how uncommon that attitude is.&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Therein lies a key to energizing any company-changing the way we look at people, events and things around us.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A change of perspective is also a key to unleashing the power of the engine technology. We use the word technology in its broadest sense as the &quot;know-how&quot; for running a business, the know-how for producing products and providing services as well as the products and services themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Information can be a product, and providing it to others is a service that requires sophisticated know-how. Gartner Group is the recognized leader in a very fast moving service industry-providing information about developments in the computer industry to manufacturers, financial analysts and end-users. The company&#39;s growth has been energized by its fresh way of looking at the technology of the services that it provides.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just before he founded the company in 1979, Gideon Gartner recognized the growing need in the marketplace for up-to-date, reliable, expert information on new developments in the computer industry. At the time, Gartner was a partner at Oppenheimer, catering to needs of institutional investors on Wall Street for information that would impact on their investments in the computer industry. But no one was using the fast moving Wall Street style to provide information on developments in the industry to other key decision-makers, such as vendors in the computer industry who needed to understand the marketing and product strategies of their competitors and large computer users who needed to know developments that might influence their decisions to purchase new systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">So Gartner redefined the product to meet these needs and create a new market by providing information of a practically useful nature to decision-makers and presenting it in a simple and concise form for easy reference.&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Adding just one new dimension to the way we look at a product or service reveals new applications and provides greater value-added to customers.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;This is only one of the ways in which the greater potentials of technology can be tapped.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">During his prior employment at IBM and Oppenheimer, Gartner had learned a variety of methods for collecting, interpreting and utilizing this type of information. But the challenge in starting his own company was to institutionalize the research process, so that every Gartner researcher would produce practically useful, accurate, timely information consistent in content with the information supplied by other researchers in the company and in an easy-to-read brief format. &quot;The better quality has to do with our approach to research, to research concept,&quot; says Gartner.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">The company has achieved a high standard by methods more commonly associated with manufacturing firms-standardized procedures, quality control and evaluation systems, and continuous training programs. The essence of this technology is set forth in the company&#39;s &quot;bible&quot;, the Research Notebook written by Gideon Gartner. This research technology has enabled the company to expand its research staff rapidly and still maintain a reputation for innovation and high quality standards.&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">Technology is also energized by implementing high corporate values like quality, systematic functioning, innovation and freedom.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These strategies have enabled Gartner to convert technology into a powerful engine for growth and a lucrative source of revenues. From 1979 to the time it was acquired by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in mid 1988, the company&#39;s revenues grew from $500,000 to $36 million, averaging an increase of about 52% each year over the last three years. Current revenues are at $62 million.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">CAPITALIZING ON A DREAM</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we speak of engines of growth, the one that first comes to mind is often capital. At Patten Corporation, capital was not the first engine, but it has certainly been one of the most important. In the mid 1960s, when Harry Patten founded the company in Stamford, Vermont, there was a surging demand among the urban population to fulfill their dream of owning a home in the countryside. Harry had developed a talent for recognizing good potential homesite property and a simple mechanism for marketing it to city-dwellers through classified ads in major metropolitan newspapers. For the next twenty years, Patten Corp. remained a small land company buying 50 to 100 acre rural plots and dividing them into 5 to 20 acre homesites for resale.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then in 1984 Harry met a young Boston financial consultant who saw the enormous potential of his business, and offered to raise capital for its growth. That year the company raised $20 million and the company&#39;s sales jumped from $4.3 million to $11.2 million. New offices were opened in Maine and New Hampshire. The following year, Patten Corp. went public and raised another $7.2 million in equity. Sales soared to $33.2 million. By 1988 the company was operating 38 branch offices, primarily in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic areas of the country, with revenues of $116 million, profits of $17.5 million and a strategic plan for doubling again by 1993.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Capital was the engine that enabled Patten to utilize the latent potentials of his long years of experience in the acquisition and marketing of rural land to expand his business 26-fold in four years. But the power of this engine goes way beyond mere investment value. Apart from its role as a factor of production, there is a whole other way of looking at finance as a means to energize the other components of a business. Again it comes back to attitude, to perspective. When finance is looked at as a measure and an index rather than an end in itself, it acquires new creative power. More on that in a later chapter.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">A PERSONAL APPROACH</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Expeditors International, based in Seattle with offices in xxx40 cities around the world, is the largest forwarder of airfreight cargo from the Far East to North America. Over the last five years its revenues have risen from $3.5 million to $147 million and profits have crossed $7 million. What has been the engine that has generated such phenomenal growth? &quot;The people,&quot; says John Kaiser, Expeditors&#39; founder. &quot;In a service business, you don&#39;t have anything that anybody else couldn&#39;t get. It requires minimal capital to get in. We have a relatively good organization. The engine or drive has been the people. We&#39;ve been able to motivate the people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Kaiser&#39;s comment is based on an understanding that goes back to the time when the company was founded. In 1979 when he and ten associates with many years of experience working for another forwarding company established Expeditors, they agreed that each of the founding partners should make a sizable personal investment in the company and share in a percentage of the profits. As new offices were opened overseas, a similar arrangement was made so that branch managers also became owners and shared in the profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Expeditors have combined good compensation with another powerful energizer-freedom. &quot;Our philosophy at that time was to spread the wealth amongst the people and make sure they all have a vested interest in the organization,&quot; Kaiser explained. &quot;One of the things that made this business grow is that the people that came on board were very confident. We make a conscious effort to make our managers at the branch level as independent as possible. If you create an atmosphere where people can operate independently and you have the right people, that&#39;s the real key in our business.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Expeditors illustrates a few of the many ways in which people can be made an engine of growth-recruiting very experienced managers from the same industry, making them investors and profit sharers, and giving them a wide latitude of freedom.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">GIVING NEW LIFE TO A DYING INDUSTRY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Of the five engines, organization contains the greatest creative power for growth, yet it is the least understood and the least utilized. In 1957 two Harvard MBAs travelling in Europe discovered and demonstrated this power to people around the world-literally!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Applying the market research techniques they had learned in business school, they discovered that shoe-repairing was a dying industry in Europe, where being a cobbler had very little social prestige. For instance, while the population of the Netherlands had increased by 50% during the previous twenty years, the number of cobblers had declined to half the previous level. The demographics were similar in other European countries. As a result, it took an average of six days to get shoes repaired in Paris or Zurich. Seeing opportunity where others saw none, the two entrepreneurs opened up a fast shoe repair service right in the midst of the prestigious Bon Marche department store in downtown Brussels. The shop, known as Mr Minit, offered fast (two minutes for a heel repair), quality, convenient, clean service for a premium price. These were the hey-days of the spike-heeled shoe and the cobblestone streets of Brussels played havoc with the new fashion. The new business was an instant success. Within a year Mr Minit shops had been opened all over Belgium.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The ability to recognize an unmet social need was the initial power behind the development of the business. But the real growth of this company had not yet begun. For that, the entrepreneurs had to find a means to reproduce their local success in hundreds of locations throughout Europe and they did. The means they discovered was the engine organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company decided to reduce all its operations to a set of codified and standardized systems, so that virtually every step in the process of establishing new service centers, recruiting and training personnel, procuring materials, relating to customers and accounting for the results was explained and documented as a standard operating procedure (SOP). As we sat in Geneva talking with the company&#39;s chairman, Hillsdon Ryan, he waved his hand at a row of at least 15 four inch thick manuals on the board room bookcase, which set forth the organizational technology that enabled the company to grow so rapidly.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Along with these systems, the company introduced a supervisory structure that was designed to make each of the service center managers an entrepreneur in his own right, while also ensuring uniform performance standards throughout the company. &quot;The supervisory structure is absolutely one of the keys to our success, an important key,&quot; says Ryan. &quot;We&#39;ve kept a lot of the spirit of freedom. We&#39;ve kept a flat organization. It is all based on very good codification of our experience in systems, because in a service business of our kind where the units are reproducible, they lend themselves to systems.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The power of that engine was made clearly evident by the remarkable expansion of the company over the next few years. First it spread horizontally by opening centers in other European capitals. Then it expanded its range of services from shoe repair to key cutting, engraving, rubber stamps and knife sharpening. Later the range was further broadened to include instant printing of cards and letterhead, watch repair, sewing and one hour photo film development. Finally, it focused on backward integration of the retail service outlets with distribution centers and manufacturing plants for the equipment, fixtures and raw materials such as key blanks and rubber stamps, thus becoming the world&#39;s largest producer of rubber stamps.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The SOPs were expanded to include detailed guidelines for establishing new foreign subsidiaries. For a period in the late 1960s, the company was opening up new subsidiaries at the rate of one every two months as it expanded from Europe to Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. &quot;These are detailed SOPs on how to operate the unit,&quot; Ryan explained. &quot;You&#39;ll find this in every country in its own language. Here we have four volumes of standards for the photo business. As far as I know, no one else in the business has this. What we did was search the whole business and write our own procedures for everything by subject. We did this early in the game, so we can now reproduce our units anywhere.&quot; And the company has done just that. By 1985 Minit International was operating 4,000 service centers in 1,400 cities in 32 countries and employing 10,000 people. Organization was the driving force for this phenomenal growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">DRIVERS, TEST YOUR ENGINES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">The word&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">driver&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c8">is important. For if you perceive that any of the five engines we have described are somehow beyond your reach or control, then we have failed to convey the point. </span><span class="c4 c6">You</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have the power to drive each of the five engines and harness its energy for growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">When we speak of market, we do not mean that big, impersonal and unpredictable world out there which is beyond any and everybody&#39;s control. Rather we refer to&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c6">your&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">perception of that market and the relationship you forge with it, both of which are directly and totally subject to your control.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we speak of technology, we do not refer to the vast movement of scientific and technological evolution which is continuously changing the way we interact with each other and the world around us. Rather we mean the way you perceive the products and services you provide and the methods you employ to generate them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we speak of capital or finance, we do not confine ourselves to the quantity of money invested in your company or the sources and means of finance you draw upon to obtain it. Finance is also a way of looking at things-not just passively in order to track performance, but actively in order to manage it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we speak of people, we are not thinking in demographic terms of numbers, age, sex or qualifications, but in terms of people&#39;s energies, knowledge, skills and capacities, their understanding and their attitudes, and how these can be fully mobilized for their personal growth and the growth of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we speak of organization, we do not refer to the organizational chart which describes the division of responsibilities and levels of authority within a company. This is only an abstract, two-dimensional, structural representation of a complex, living organism with manifold and immense productive capabilities. An organizational chart has never doubled anything, except perhaps payrolls and bureaucracy, while organization in the true sense has virtually unlimited creative power.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Words are a great limitation, because we must use common nouns to describe uncommon powers. Once again, think about your own company. What is the source of its energies? What has propelled its growth?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have included a business self-evaluation form at the end of this chapter to assist you in assessing the relative development of each of the five components of your company as they exist today. Knowing where we are is the first step for accelerating growth. Our understanding of where we are is usually based to a great extent on impressions. An exercise like this enables us to formalize and objectify our assessment and to compare it with the perception of other people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Take a few minutes to evaluate your business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Five essential components are necessary for the existence, survival and growth of a business-market, technology, people, capital and organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Each of these five contains vast untapped potentials which are within the reach of every company.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Any one of them can be converted into an engine for doubling a company&#39;s performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Development of all five releases opportunities for an endless expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">BUSINESS SELF-EVALUATION QUESTIONNAIRE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c6">Instructions</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This questionnaire contains five sections, one for each of the five engines.

Which of the five components has been the most important engine for the growth of revenues and profits in your company up to now? Which should be the engine for its future growth? Which of the five has the greatest inherent power to propel growth?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The relative importance of these five has always been a lively issue for debate. Dedicated sales people will emphatically insist that the market, the customer, is the real key to any business. With equal vigor, design and production engineers will stress the dominant role of technology in the success of a business. Of course, every human resource manager knows that people are the real key. As one put it: &quot;Without people you&#39;ve got nothing!&quot; Financial analysts often laugh at the other three and quietly remind them that, after all, capital is the foundation, the means and the end of every business, without which the others are powerless. And occasionally-very occasionally-you run across an experienced executive who will present a view similar to that of Andrew Carnegie, who once said, &quot;Take away everything else, but leave me my organization and in ten years I&#39;ll be back on top.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And as with people, so with companies. In board rooms across the country there are intense debates as to whether the company should be market-driven or product-driven, people-oriented or systems-oriented, dedicated to profits or to quality, and so on. Ask most managers and they will immediately tell you one or another of the five is most important. And within the same company, you can hear many different views.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Who&#39;s right? Which is the most important engine for growth? Steve Bedowitz, CEO of AMRE, insists quite emphatically: &quot;All of them. Every single one of them makes up the engine. It is not any one alone. I know a brilliant man who has great ideas, but every time he starts, he goes bankrupt because he doesn&#39;t have all the pieces of the engine. No one piece can stand alone. There are a lot of pieces. One reason we will keep on growing is because we found all the pieces to put together.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bedowitz has hit on the secret. A closer look at any business will reveal that not one but several engines have played important roles in its growth and that all five have been developed at least to the minimum level required to support that growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">People was certainly a driving force for the growth of Expeditors, but the highly decentralized entrepreneurial structure the company has developed relies to a great extent for its success on the standardized operating procedures employed by all the branches and the strong control systems top management employs to monitor their activities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Technology has been a major driving force behind the growth of Gartner Group, but the company&#39;s ability to attune its research products very carefully to meet the information needs of its customers (market) and its ability to attract and motivate bright, high energy sales people, who are nearly twice as productive as the competition (people), have also been critical success factors.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear Technology&#39;s growth is the result of a fine balance and coordination between research (technology) and the market supported by an environment that provides great freedom and high levels of compensation to its people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The rapid influx of new capital enabled Patten Corporation to increase its inventories and expand its operations 26-fold, but it has been the company&#39;s ability to properly recruit and motivate managers for its new branches (people) and its expertise in identification and acquisition of the right properties for investment (technology) that has ensured that proper utilization of those funds to consistently return high profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The global expansion of Minit International was made possible by the organizational structure and systems it put into place. But recruiting the right type of people who possess qualities of both craftsmen and entrepreneurs, training them in a wide variety of technical skills and motivating them to high levels of productivity and customer service was made possible by the emphasis the company placed on the engine people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The real issue is not whether a company should be market-driven, product-driven, people-driven, systems-driven or profit-driven.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">If any company wants to grow and keep growing profitably, it needs to develop all five; because each of these five is an engine that contains within itself virtually unlimited potentials for expansion and in order to more fully tap the potentials of any one, the others must be developed proportionately as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That is what Waltz Brothers discovered in 1986.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A BANKER&#39;S ERROR</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Waltz Brothers is a precision machining company founded in Chicago 50 years ago by three brothers, who all retired in 1976 leaving the business to their four sons.to manage The company specializes in machining parts to incredibly close dimensional tolerances of three-ten thousandths of an inch. The four cousins worked hard to build on the good reputation established by their fathers and their work soon began paying rich dividends. In the early eighties the company became a major supplier of computer disk drive shafts to IBM and to companies in the aerospace industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1985 sales soared and revenues rocketed from $3 million to $5 million in one year. Excited by the great potential for continued growth, the company purchased new equipment, moved into a new modern building in a suburb of Chicago, hired lots of new people and took every new job they could get their hands on.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For a while rapid growth was exhilarating. Then problems began to surface. In a business where quality and on-time delivery are paramount, quality declined and deliveries fell behind schedule. Only 40% of jobs were completed on time. Dissatisfied customers started sending back rejected parts. Then they stopped sending in new orders. Orders by one major customer dropped from $500,000 to $10,000. As suddenly as the surge of new business had appeared, it suddenly disappeared and with it the partner&#39;s profits and their dreams.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One day their banker called them in to point out that the company was losing money at the rate of $350,000 a year. It came as a big shock to the partners, because profit was something they had always taken for granted. The banker asked them how they planned to repay the plant and equipment loans. Then he said, &quot;Your days are numbered. By our estimate you can survive for only one or two more months.&quot; The cousins were stunned by the imminent demise of a business which their fathers had nurtured and developed over five decades and which had recently seemed on the verge of taking off.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In that brief meeting with their bankers, the Waltzes discovered what thousands of companies have learned in the past. Rapid growth is not only one of the most exhilarating experiences that a company can have, it is also one of the most challenging and potentially dangerous. It is not very difficult to grow rapidly, but it is difficult to grow rapidly and profitably and to keep growing profitably over a prolonged period of time. That explains why 23% of the fast growing companies on INC.&#39;s 1988 list were losing money.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All these fast growing companies have discovered the explosive power of at least one of the five engines. But why when they are so buoyant and expansive do they so often run into trouble? Because they have not learned the second basic truth about the five engines, a truth which we all were taught at the dinner table when we were children-the importance of balance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Waltzes discovered that truth after their meeting with the banker. When the Waltzes returned to their office, their sole objective was to prove that the banker&#39;s prophecy was wrong. They realized that in expanding rapidly they had focused almost all their attention on two of the five components-market and technology, the customer and the machine-and in the process had neglected other essential components of profitable growth-people, organization and capital. Sales had grown faster than their operating systems could handle and their people could manage. Expenditure rose faster than their financial systems could control. In other words, in growing rapidly the five components had grown out of balance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">So the Waltzes formulated a comprehensive strategy for saving their company by eliminating weaknesses in each of the five components and restoring the balance between them at the same time. First, they took a serious look at their market and decided they had to change their approach. They redefined their mission as a company, evolved a new marketing strategy and made a serious effort to improve the service they provided to customers. They set as a goal to raise on-time deliveries from 40% to 90%. Rejection rates were brought down from 8% to less than 1%. On-time deliveries rose above the 90% standard.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They energized their people by introducing a series of training programs. They hired an outside agency to teach 8 week courses on statistical quality control and gave their foremen a five week advanced course in supervisory skills. They also introduced a profit-sharing program to enable their employees to participate in their success. As a result, productivity soared and costs fell.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They also tapped the potentials of the component capital. They introduced some stringent cost cutting, eliminating every unnecessary expense-including free coffee in the office. They found they could achieve a 25% cost savings on raw materials by negotiating long term contracts with vendors like their customers negotiated with them. Expendable tools was another area that improved. Machining bits were being thrown away prematurely. By purchasing one with a better coating, they found productivity could be raised. Then they introduced a sophisticated budgeting system to help them control costs and closely monitor key performance indicators which enabled them to accurately project manpower requirements in advance of actual need. They carefully analyzed new machinery purchases to determine whether the investments were actually justified.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">They also tapped some of the potentials of technology. They purchased a computer controlled grinder, which met a small need, and then marketed their new capabilities and filled the expanded capacity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And finally, they restructured and streamlined their organization by redefining the responsibilities of the four partners and improving the systems for inventory control, budgeting, monitoring performance, scheduling, and quality control.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As a result of these efforts, net income went from a negative $350,000 in 1985 to a positive $30,000 in 1986 and to $500,000 in 1987-a net increase equivalent to 17% of revenues in two years. The company also received a prestigious quality award from IBM.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Waltz Brothers recovered from the brink of bankruptcy by tapping some of the latent potentials of the five engines and by restoring the balance between them. What the Waltz Brothers have done in a time of crisis, every company can do at any time to grow rapidly and profitably.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A DELICATE BLEND</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The real key to non-stop growth is a harmonious and balanced development of all five components, either successively or simultaneously. Each of the five is a powerful engine for growth, but each also depends on the other four in order to fully flower and express its potentials. When the development of any one of the five exceeds the present requirements of the company, the surplus energies from that component overflow and begin to stimulate the development of the others. When people are energized, customers are attracted to the company, systems work faster and better, money is utilized more efficiently and technological innovation increases. When the market is energized, employees are more enthusiastic, development of new technologies is stimulated and systems are constantly being improved. When organization is tuned to perform at peak levels of efficiency, people feel more relaxed and happy, service to customers is superior, costs are reduced and coordination between research, production and the market improves.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The reverse is also true. The lack of development of any one of the five components retards the development of the other four. The market for our product may be strong. But if we lack the technology needed to maintain quality, we cannot fully tap that market. We may have the most talented and highly motivated people, but without the right type of structure to direct them and the right type of systems to carry out routine operations effortlessly, anarchy and burnout will be the main result. We may have the best technology, but if we lack people with enough energy and the right skills, the market may not respond to what we offer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">UNIVAC learned from IBM the cost of ignoring one of the five back in the 1950s when it became the first company to bring computers to the marketplace. Despite the fact that the UNIVAC machine was considered far superior, IBM took away 75% of the computer market within the first five years. IBM knew that a highly educated, trained and motivated sales force (people) was as important for success as a good product (technology).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.20px; height: 235.87px;"><img alt="A Typical Profile of the Five Engines of Business" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 450.20px; height: 235.87px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Figure 1. A Typical Profile of the Five Engines of Business</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Figure 1 is a very typical profile of the five engines of a business. It shows that the components market and technology are relatively well developed. Like Mr Minit and Linear Technology, it is in close touch with the needs of its market. Like Gartner Group and Patten, it has developed technology to a high level. But the components people and organization are relatively weaker, as they are in a majority of fast growing companies. The horizontal line shows the level of full utilization of potentials based on the development of the weakest component, organization. The areas of market and technology above the line represent capacities that cannot be fully utilized for lack of appropriate supporting strength in people and organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A THREE-ENGINE PLANE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As the Waltzes found out, an unbalanced development of the five components can slow or stop growth in its tracks and that is precisely what happens to most fast growing companies. Like many other small commuter airlines, the birth of Mesa Airlines in Farmington, New Mexico in 1982 was spawned by deregulation of the commercial airline industry. However, unlike many other young commuter services, Mesa has been able to remain profitable.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of the keys to Mesa&#39;s survival and growth in a highly competitive market, where even the majors have taken some beatings, has been its ability to identify markets with latent demand for commuter services in which it could effectively compete against other carriers. When competition on the Farmington-Albuquerque route heated up, Mesa dropped its fare from $48 to $25 to match the competition. When competitors later raised their prices again, Mesa kept theirs low because they had discovered a significant increase in demand for seats at the lower rate, which enabled them to achieve 20% higher load factors than their competitors.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But apart from just competing cost-effectively, Mesa has been able to actually create new markets between cities where air travel had not existed earlier. Founder-President Larry Risley explained: &quot;We want to get the price down as low as we can and get the volume up as high as we can...That way we get people travelling. We make less profit per seat, but because we fill more seats, the flight is making a profit...We&#39;ve stimulated the market with fares. We get people talking about how easy it is to travel from point A to point B. That&#39;s how we built the market from Farmington to Albuquerque, which was non-existent...The engines that have propelled our growth have been the ability to recognize the potential markets and fit the right size equipment to them, so that we could operate profitably.&quot; Mesa has become adept at entering new markets, testing out new fares and quickly withdrawing from those that are not profitable.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Market, technology (the right equipment) and capital (cost management) have been the engines that propelled the growth of Mesa from $2.1 million in 1984 to $14.4 million in 1987. During this same period profits also rose from $185,000 to $790,000. Then quite suddenly, everything stopped. Even with three engines driving it forward, the airline lost its momentum.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we visited Mesa in mid-1988, Larry Risley, the company&#39;s founder and CEO, explained why Mesa had stopped growing last year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;We&#39;ve hit a point of stabilization. Our growth is down to 4-5% annually. What caused us to stop growing was our inability to staff it properly. I&#39;m not saying that we quit growing purposely. I&#39;m saying it went beyond my capacities at the time. I didn&#39;t learn quick enough. My management staff didn&#39;t learn quick enough. It put us on the back side of the power curve. Our reliability was going down. Our customer confidence was starting to fall. The employee loyalties began to drop-morale and all. You couldn&#39;t go out and put your finger on the cause exactly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mesa stopped growing because it lost its balance. While Risley was focusing on market, technology and capital, the components people and organization got left behind. The company was so busy developing its markets, that it forgot to develop its people and its organization. As market expansion continued, it quite literally overran the runway. Mesa was slow to build up the management team, structure and systems needed for nonstop growth. Risley continued to manage the company as he had when it was much smaller, keeping information &quot;close to the chest&quot; and refusing to delegate.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mesa has been fortunate. Even though growth has slowed, the company has remained profitable. It may be able to restore the balance and take off again in the near future. Many other companies are not so fortunate. In the early 1970s a dynamic young entrepreneur with a real talent for marketing and a real appreciation for high technology products opened up an electronics store in Chicago. The store&#39;s sales grew rapidly and it was quite profitable. Soon the entrepreneur opened a second store, then a third. Within a few years the company was operating eight stores in Illinois, which the CEO visited regularly by private plane. Revenues soared to $8 million, but profits remained at about the level they had been when the company operated only two stores. By 1978 the company was in trouble. To the surprise of top management, an analysis of the business revealed that only the first two stores were making money and, in fact, the other six had never been profitable. Although the company had expanded its number of outlets, it had never built up an organization to manage its growing empire and it had never put in the financial systems to control inventory and costs in multiple locations. The owners did not even recognize they had a problem until it was too late. Here too, an unbalanced development of the five components halted growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The experience of this company is in striking contrast to another company in the same industry, Audio Craft in Cleveland. The company is a leader in its field with one of the best profit records year after year. An analysis of the company shows that all five components are well-developed and in balance. The company shares the traditional strengths of other companies in the industry-a very strong commitment to customer service and a high level of technological expertise. But Audio Craft is also strong in three areas where many of its competitors are relatively weak-finance, organization and people. CEO Wayne Puntel is famous among his peers in the industry for the sophisticated systems he has installed to help him manage and control his six stores efficiently and effortlessly. He also has developed very effective training programs to continuously improve the skills of his sales force and strong incentive and recognition programs to motivate and reward them. In spite of this high performance, Puntel is continuously striving to generate more power from the five engines by developing them further in a balanced manner. Last year that effort generated an additional 40% increase in profitability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When things get out of balance, some companies take a conscious decision to slow down or stop the growth before it leads to trouble. At the time we visited Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s Homemade Ice Cream in Burlington, Vermont, the founder and President, Ben Cohen, had just put out a directive-&quot;No more growth.&quot; Ben and co-founder Jerry Greenfield started the company in an abandoned gas station in 1978. Between 1981 and 1988, sales multiplied 75-fold to top $45 million. Now there is heated debate going on regarding an issue quite familiar to ice cream lovers-Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The growth of this company has been propelled by the engines market (great ads and promotions), technology (a wonderful product) and highly motivated people. Its one weak point has been organization. &quot;Growth is our double-edged sword,&quot; says David Barasch, &quot;The number 1 issue here is whether we should keep growing. Do we have the internal organizational tenacity and structure to be able to do it? Do we have the right people? The right checks and balances? It all boils down to communication...things happening out of coordination...The feeling that we are swimming up stream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ben described the issue from his perspective: &quot;Growth has been a heated topic in our company for the last eight years. The word growth is interesting. You have inner and outer growth, qualitative and quantitative growth. Right now I want to stop the quantitative growth, so that we can concentrate on the quality.&quot; To which Jerry retorted, &quot;We talk about slower quantitative growth, but we continually make decisions that will fuel greater growth!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The issue which Ben and Jerry are coping with is far from academic. Companies that refuse to pay attention to these symptoms are forced to compensate by driving their people harder or spending more and more money or compromising further and further on quality or lowering prices to maintain growing volumes. The result is steadily rising costs and complications, steadily deteriorating customer and employee satisfaction-until finally the floor or the roof caves in and they are forced to stop and pick up the pieces, if it is not already too late. Two of the 100 companies listed by INC. in 1986 were already out of business one year later.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Any company that focuses on one or two components to the exclusion of the others, runs the risk of becoming a leaning tower-a company like Chrysler Corporation in the 1960s and 1970s which focused on technology at the expense of the other four (particularly market), until the company was brought to the brink of disaster.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CORPORATE ANATOMY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are many similarities between the functioning of the human body and the functioning of a company. But they differ in one major respect. As a biological life form, the body naturally grows and develops in an organic manner. The growth of each part of the body occurs simultaneously and in correct proportion to all the others. The right arm and the left lengthen proportionately. The nerves, muscles and blood vessels extend in proportion to the growth of the bones. As they grow, the links between them-the cartilage, ligaments and tendons-automatically extend to ensure proper connection between the bones and muscles.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Whereas in a company, balanced and proportionate growth cannot be taken for granted and is, in fact, rather unusual. Like the body, organizations do expand in many directions simultaneously. Structures, systems, positions, policies and rules grow along with the number of people and offices and the volume of production. But they often grow at different rates and in different directions. Frequently they grow without proper systems and procedures to link them together. Therefore, in examining the anatomy of a company, the human body is a good image of how a company should but usually does not grow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The body and the organization differ in one other important respect. The growth of the body is not only organic, it is also subconscious, which means that it is not under our conscious control. Organizations grow subconsciously too. They expand naturally without anyone really thinking about all the parts and their interrelationships. But they do have a choice. Companies can exert conscious control over their own development and achieve through effort and alertness what the body accomplishes through subconscious processes. The ability of management to understand the subconscious process of human physical development and replicate it in the company is a key to non-stop, rapid corporate growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The five engines constitute the anatomy of a business. They are like the essential organs of the body-the brain, heart, lungs, stomach and liver. Their role in corporate growth can be understood from three distinct perspectives. First, each is important and crucial in its own right. The heart, like the market, must be strong and healthy. The brain, like the people, should be alert and energetic, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Second, each must also be developed in proper proportion to the others. As the lungs must be sufficiently developed to provide all the oxygen needed by the brain and heart, technology must provide new products and services to serve a growing market. As the liver must be capable of purifying all the blood which the heart pumps, capital must be capable of providing sufficient support for innovations in technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Third, in addition to their absolute importance and the need for balanced development, there is also a need for harmonious interaction and close coordination between them. When the heart beats faster, the lungs must pump more oxygen and the liver must filter more blood. When the market expands, people in all parts of the company must be able to respond with energy and skill. Capital must circulate more quickly. Production and research (technology) must accelerate their activity. If for even a short interval the synergy is lost between the organs of the body, the body collapses into coma. The same is true of companies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This harmonious coordination is not only essential for life. It is also the key to health and vitality-both for the body and the company. Companies that are able to establish and maintain very high levels of synergy between the five engines are able to continuously grow rapidly and profitably.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE VIEW AT THE TOP</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What determines the relative strength, balance and coordination of the five engines in a company? It starts with the people at the top-their understanding, their attitudes and their preferences. If the CEO or the top management team believes that this is a technology-driven company, it will be. If they believe that people are the driving force, people will be. The real balancing act takes place in the minds of the leaders.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are many ways to spoil a healthy diet. We have been in companies where top management only believes in the market and never builds up an organization or people to support the market. We have been in companies where the CEO was so committed to organization that he has systematized the life out of the company. We have even met senior executives put so much emphasis on training that sales people, who are subjected to the same &quot;motivational&quot; video-taped training programs year after year, secretly speed up the tapes whenever the training supervisor is not looking.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The role of the CEO is to ensure that all five powers are seen in proper perspective, that their capacities are fully recognized and their interrelationships are fully appreciated. Fred Smith, founder and CEO of Federal Express, has understood that maintaining a dynamic balance between the five engines is an important part of his job.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;I purposely populate the ranks of the senior officers with champions of disparate points of view. I don&#39;t want a chief financial officer who is an existentialist. I want a chief financial officer who is very dollars and cents oriented, almost to a fault. Then over on the marketing side, I&#39;d like somebody who is very dissatisfied unless we&#39;re prepared to give away the product and pay the customer. In this way you create a contention in the organization where there are alternative points of view. That keeps me intellectually honest...As you grow you have to be careful that you don&#39;t get the components out of balance. Companies that survive have this sort of intuitive knowledge.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A BALANCING ACT</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The view from the top is not the only view or necessarily the most objective. CEOs who ask other managers of the company to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the five components are often surprised to learn how differently the company is perceived from other vantage points. One CEO who had performed the exercise three or four times over two years commented jocularly, &quot;Every time I rate the company, my scores go up. Every time the rest of the management team rates it, their scores go down!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chuck Kittleson of Century Stereo in Palo Alto administered the questionnaire to his employees and then undertook a systematic effort to strengthen the company on all the areas they had identified as relatively weak, even those that appeared relatively minor. Apart from the changes he implemented, the effort itself had a profound impact on morale and performance. Over the next one year, the company&#39;s profits doubled.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Henry Triesler, president of Precision Grinding Inc. in Phoenix, gave the questionnaire to all his managers. He then held weekly staff meetings for the next six months discussing their answers to each question and eliciting suggestions on how to raise the company&#39;s performance in each area. This exercise helped his company go from heavy losses to strong profits in a little more than a year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The very act of giving serious attention to all five engines has a power to release some of their latent energies. That was enough to double the performance of these two companies. Then what will be the result if these powers are fully tapped and systematically utilized? An endless expansion of revenues and profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Examine the relative strength of the five engines of your company and sketch them on a bar chart. Which are the strongest? In an absolute sense according to your own ratings, how much further scope it there to strengthen these strong components? Which are the weakest and how much scope is there to strengthen them? Now compare the relative levels of their development. How evenly are they balanced? How much developed capacity in the stronger components remains unutilized because one or more of the other components are not sufficiently developed to support it?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Where should a company be concentrating its efforts for further growth? Should it focus on the stronger components or the weaker ones? About 50% of companies have excess unutilized capacity already developed (a strength which is not able to fully express itself) in at least one component. If fully utilized, this capacity is often enough to double the company&#39;s performance. But utilizing that excess capacity requires the proportionate strengthening of the other components. Companies that focus on fully exploiting their strengths invariably end up reinforcing the weaker areas to restore a balance between the components. The balancing occurs naturally, even if the strategy is not conceived in this manner. If you review the growth of your own company, you should be able to identify this process at work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">An understanding of where we are is the first essential step. But recognizing the power of the five engines and the importance of balanced development is not enough to generate and sustain high rates of rapid, profitable growth. For that, we must know how to tap the potentials of each of these five, to release their energies, to channel them effectively and convert them into practical results in terms of high performance, high profits and increasing revenues. For that there is a process, the process we referred to in Chapter One, a process which anyone can learn and apply in their own business. This leads us from the subject of corporate anatomy to the realm of corporate physiology.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Companies grow by developing the potentials of the five components and converting them into engines for growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Each component can be developed in itself and each can drive the growth of the other four.

When he speaks, people listen. When he says that American business can beat the foreign competition-including the Japanese-he speaks with authority and experience. Corner is one of the old breed-or is it the new breed?-of entrepreneurs that believes anything is possible and means to prove it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But Corner did not always feel and talk this way. Back about six years ago, Corner was in trouble. The early 1980s were a tough time for companies in the tool and die industry. Intense competition from Asian manufactures had already driven many major U.S. manufacturers overseas, reducing the demand for tools and dies at home. Then the industry was hit by a second wave of attack from foreign tool and die makers entering the previously inviolate domestic market, which conventional wisdom said would never happen since close communication between tool maker and manufacturer makes proximity very important. But it did happen to the industry and to Corner.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Corner is founder of C &amp; J Industries in Meadville, Pennsylvania and a former President of the National Tooling and Machining Association. He awoke one morning to find many of his long-established customers buying molds from his Japanese competition. And the reasons were not difficult to understand. The Japanese were offering their custom-made molds delivered in the U.S. at lower prices and with faster delivery dates averaging 16 weeks compared with C &amp; J Industries 32 weeks.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Unlike many in his industry who resigned themselves to apparently inevitable decline, Corner decided to take up the challenge and fight back. He set as his goals to cut his production costs and delivery dates to less than that of his foreign competitors and announced his intentions to every employee in the company. He then set about reviewing and revamping virtually every system, operation and activity in the company to raise performance to the highest possible level. He introduced a massive training program for upgrading the skills of people at all levels of the company, including special training on how to use systems more effectively. He also launched a quality program to get all his people involved in improving the molds they made.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Over the next 30 months, Corner brought down his production time from 32 weeks to 16 weeks and cut operating costs by $540,000. Business poured in and the company began to grow rapidly. During this period sales increased by 40% to cross $10 million in 1987, then rose another 30% in 1988 and are projected to reach $17.5 million in 1989-a near tripling of the company&#39;s revenues. Corner&#39;s remarkable turnaround illustrates the latent potential available to any company for tremendous improvements in performance within a short period of time. It also illustrates key elements of the process by which companies energize themselves for growth. It all starts with energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Over the last few years we have asked more than 1,000 U.S. and foreign companies to describe to us their most recent experience of rapid growth. Their responses reveal that during periods of rapid growth, companies share several common characteristic: a high level of energy and enthusiasm, a clear sense of direction, smooth running systems, good coordination and teamwork, good morale, pride, non-stop recruitment of new people and continuous learning of new skills. These characteristics reduce to four essential elements: high energy, clear direction, streamlined organization, skilled and motivated people. The relationships and interactions between these four are the keys to the process of converting corporate potentials into practical results in terms of high performance, high profitability and rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">In our study of major U.S. corporations with long histories of sustained growth described in</span><a id="id.s9barwv4i9uy"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The Vital Difference: Unleashing the Powers of Sustained Corporate Success</span><span class="c8">, co-authored by Garry Jacobs and Frederick Harmon,</span><span class="c15">3</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">we described the tangibly intense atmosphere of energy we experienced in high performance companies like Apple Computers, Intel, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Marriott, Coca-Cola, General Mills, Delta Airlines and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. High energy is the fuel and driving force for high achievement. It excites and enthuses people to great efforts and accomplishments. It spurs the organization to perfect its operations and raise the quality of its performance. It attracts customers, motivates employees and stimulates creativity and innovation. The generation and unleashing of that energy and its effective utilization by the company are the keys to an endless expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The single most common characteristic reported by fast growing companies is a high level of energy. The task of accelerating the growth of a business requires an enormous amount of energy and hard work. Most companies feel comfortable growing leisurely at rates of 5, 10 or 15% a year and find that demanding enough on their energies. To grow at higher rates-30, 40, 50% or more-means to accelerate the process and that is considerably more demanding.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Regardless of the rate of growth, energy is the fuel for that expansion, and accelerated growth, like high speed driving and flying, demands a proportionately or disproportionately greater amount of fuel. Without that energy you cannot even think of doubling. You cannot plan for it or build for it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That energy starts with the people at the top-the founder, the CEO and the management team. They must generate energy, embody it, radiate it, communicate it to everyone else in the company and express it in everything they do. That energy is needed to maintain and develop every component and every activity of the company: to formulate and implement plans, to give and carry out instructions, to maintain regular production, to meet delivery schedules, even to maintain facilities in a clean and orderly fashion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Energy is needed to enthuse our people, to excite our customers, to attract investors, to negotiate with vendors, to carry conviction with the board and the management team and every employee in the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the energy level in your company. Before planning to double or triple the company, you should be sure there is sufficient energy to achieve that goal. Are you generating and releasing sufficient energy to carry on routine operations effectively and to propel the growth of the business? Unlike the fuel capacity of a car or plane, the energy of a company is not fixed or subject to any finite limits. Our own energy level and the energy level of our people is under our control and it can always be increased. In later chapters we will be examining many ways to release further energy in yourself, in your customers, in those who report to you and even in your boss, if you have one.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Energy is the starting point, but energy alone is not enough. By itself it is aimless, uncontrolled and unproductive. It will not produce anything. It may even become destructive like the raw energy of a cyclonic wind or a raging river. In order for a company to utilize that energy effectively, it must possess the other three characteristics we referred to earlier-a clear direction, a streamlined and efficient organization, skilled and well-motivated people. Direction, organization and people focus and channel the energy and convert it into higher sales and profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DIRECTION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Companies give direction to their energy by formulating goals to define their purpose and intentions. These goals are both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative goals define how large the company wants to become-large in terms of revenues or profits or production volumes or offices in the city, the state, the country or the world. Companies also direct their energies by establishing shorter term quantitative objectives-to double revenues in two years, to triple profits in three, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quantitative goals describe what or how much a company wants to achieve. Qualitative goals define the manner in which it wants to achieve them. Disney wants its theme parks to be spotlessly clean and its employees to be cheerful and friendly. Federal Express wants every parcel to be delivered on time. Marriott focuses on carrying out every routine activity in a systematic manner. Dupont gives a near fanatical importance to safety. Merck is obsessed with product quality. Northwestern Mutual places a tremendous importance on communication and teamwork. Delta wants all its employees to feel happy and secure as part of the corporate family. IBM is deeply committed to the growth and development of its people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Qualitative goals like cleanliness, orderliness, punctuality, safety, systematic functions, communication, coordination, service to customers, teamwork and development of our people are what we mean by corporate values. These values help us communicate to everyone in the company and to our customers and vendors precisely what type of performance we are trying to achieve. They direct the energies of our people, not only at the level of senior management, but all the way down through the organization by clearly stating how each activity should be performed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Values focus and concentrate energy. Think of how much energy it takes for Disney to maintain a commitment to the value of cleanliness when 100,000 visitors edit check figures with company-including children of all ages-go through the park in a single day. Or how much energy is required for Federal Express to achieve 96% performance on their value of the on-time delivery, when a single plane delayed by bad weather could result in 30,000 disappointed customers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">According to the laws of physics, when energy is given a specific direction it becomes capable of accomplishing work. By giving direction to the energies in a company, corporate values and objectives convert those energies into a force. They not only focus the available energy. They also magnify it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We all have seen the power of a goal to release people&#39;s energies for an extraordinary effort. In the last two minutes of the 1989 Superbowl game, the San Francisco 49ers drove 95 yards to score a touchdown and come from behind to beat the Cincinnati Bengals for the national championship. During that drive Joe Montana and his team moved down the field with a power and effectivity they had not displayed during the previous 58 minutes of the game. That is the power of a goal to release and direct energies for accomplishment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How effectively does your company give direction to the energies of its people? How clear and inspiring are its values and objectives? How fully are they understood and endorsed by people at different levels? In later chapters we will be looking at ways to increase commitment to corporate goals and enhance their power to release and focus people&#39;s energies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A SUPERTANKER CHANGING COURSE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nedlloyd Lines is a 100 year old Dutch shipping company, a $1 billion company with the largest worldwide network of routes, the largest fleet under the Dutch flag and a very strong financial position. Those who know this somewhat traditional and conservative company well refer to it as &quot;a sleeping giant in the process of awakening.&quot; As a first step toward that goal, the top management of the company has been actively trying to raise the level of energy and enthusiasm within the company by opening up the channels of communication, getting people involved and giving them an opportunity to participate in discussions about the company&#39;s future. The second step has been to provide a clear direction for the energies. Senior management has formulated a strategic plan to double its revenues over the next five years, that is, to achieve in the next five years growth equal to that which the company achieved over the last one hundred. Announcement of the company&#39;s plans to purchase $750 million in new container vessels over the next five years has sent shock waves through the company and the rest of the industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Having successfully initiated this process and stirred the energies of this vast company, the Chief Executive, Theo M Oostinjen, has a major concern. Will Nedlloyd&#39;s organization be able to properly channel and effectively utilize the energy that is being released? &quot;How can we ensure that all the energy which is released will be properly harnessed for productive purposes, that it does not generate unrealistic expectations and impatience that end in frustration?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Oostinjen&#39;s concern should be shared by every executive who tries to accelerate corporate growth. Because releasing energy and giving it a direction are not sufficient to achieve results. That energy needs to be controlled and properly channeled into productive activities. It needs to be converted from raw force into organizational power. That is the role of an organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ORGANIZATION&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When a company&#39;s energies are given a clear direction, they are ready for purposeful action. But that still is not enough to ensure that the company will grow rapidly and profitably and keep on growing. A mob possesses a high level of excited energy and a passionate direction, but mobs are only effective for destructive purposes, and even then they are not very efficient. Even in physics, a force must act on or through some instrument in order to accomplish work. Heat cannot do work in a vacuum. Electricity cannot do work unless it is converted into mechanical power by a machine.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order for the directed energy in a company to become a productive power, it has to be channeled through an organization and harnessed to carry out specific tasks. Organization defines levels of responsibility and authority: who will make which decisions, who will give what instructions, who will execute each type of work, who will monitor and evaluate the work. Organization defines systems and procedures: how each operation is to be performed, how it will be communicated, and how different operations will be coordinated. Organization utilizes the energy of countless people-workers, supervisors, technicians, engineers, scientists, administrators, sales and marketing personnel, accountants, managers, etc.-to carry out a multitude of specialized activities according to specific plans in order to implement the company&#39;s values and achieve its objectives.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imagine Joe Montana trying to drive his team down field without assigning each player to a specific position (job) and without a portfolio of carefully orchestrated plays to run (operating systems). He might find ten receivers going deep for a pass on a play he intended to run. Even if his team consisted entirely of highly motivated superstars, their enthusiastic energy and physical power would be no match for any well-organized team of professional players running well practised plays.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think of your organization as a power plant which harnesses the raw energy of a river and converts it into productive power. How much of the available energy is the organization able to mobilize? How effectively does it control and channel that energy for productive work and expansion? How efficiently does it utilize the energy in its routine operations to maximize profitability? In subsequent chapters we will be examining strategies to convert a good organization into a championship team.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SWITCHING ON PEOPLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization focuses and distributes the energy precisely to the points at which it is needed and guides its expression through policies, rules and systems. This gives organization a tremendous power to accomplish work. But the quality and effectivity of that work finally depends on one more crucial element-people. The skills and attitudes of our people are the last vital link in the process of converting that raw energy into practical results-high performance, high profitability and rapid growth. A company may have the best laid plans and the most sophisticated systems, but if the skills and attitudes of its people are not appropriate, it cannot achieve the maximum results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How many companies seem to forget this self-evident fact? You pay $3,000 for a round-trip airline ticket to the Orient and when you ask the flight attendant for a blanket so you can sleep through the long flight, she tells you matter-of-factly that there are none left-without so much as a smile or an apology--a $3000 ticket with no blanket, no apology and no smile!--either because she has not been properly trained or she is not properly motivated. Here you are flying on a $50 million dollar plane belonging to a billion dollar airline with tens of thousands of employees and a worldwide network of routes, but what you remember about the flight is the blanket, the smile and the apology which the company forgot. It is a matter of skill and attitude.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You check into a luxury resort hotel at 3:00 in the afternoon with confirmed reservations made weeks in advance and the check-in clerk informs you that your room is not ready and asks you to check back in an hour or two. When you ask him to call you in the restaurant as soon as the room is ready, he informs you that there is no procedure for doing so. Is there a procedure for the room not being ready on time? It is a matter of skill and attitude.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are literally hundreds of skills and attitudes that impact on the performance of our people. Each is like the hair thin filament in a light bulb. There may be plenty of power flowing through the electrical wires, but if that tiny little filament is broken--no light. If even a single skill or positive attitude is missing, the circuit is not complete.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The reverse is also true. In every company there are hundreds of small connections that are not being made right now, because a small filament is missing. Provide that missing link and astonishing results may follow. One CEO saw his business literally triple in a year, growing from $400,000 to $1.2 million, after he took a course to improve his interpersonal skills and he learned how to be more friendly in dealing with his customers. One course, one skill tripled his business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Do your people have all the skills they need to get the maximum results from their efforts and maximum profits for the company? What more can you do to switch on your people for peak performance?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SAS TAKES OFF</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Jan Carlzon took over as CEO of Scandanavian Airlines in 1981, the company was losing altitude. It had lost $20 million the previous year. The market was stagnant. Energy and morale were low. Performance was sagging. In a business dedicated to getting you there fast, SAS had acquired a reputation for late departures and late arrivals. Punctuality had deteriorated so much that customers sometimes joked that the company&#39;s customer service was so good that if you were late arriving at the airport for your flight, chances were the plane would still be there waiting for you.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Much has been written about the story of SAS&#39;s turnaround, including a book by Carlzon himself. The steps that he took to re-vitalize the company are an excellent example of the power of the process we have been describing. His first task was to raise the energy level. He did that by pouring his own energies into the company, meeting with his management team and addressing groups of employees to stir them out of complacency.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.8d34oa7u367b"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Next, he gave a new direction to the company by formulating a new mission, values and objectives. The mission was &quot;to become the world&#39;s best airline for the business traveller.&quot; The values he focused on were punctuality (on-time departures), pleasing the customer, and employee involvement. He set a standard to raise on-time departures to 100%. The objectives were explicit too: increase profits by $25 million in one year and by $50 million in three years. To ensure that the message was communicated down to every employee in the company, he distributed copies of a small booklet to all 20,000 employees describing the new mission and goals. These goals evoked an enthusiastic response from the people, a new energy, and focused that energy for a dramatic comeback.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Carlzon writes: &quot;Once they understood the vision, our employees accepted responsibility enthusiastically, which sparked numerous simultaneous and energetic developments in the company...The new energy at SAS was the result of 20,000 employees all striving toward a single goal every day.&quot;</span><span class="c15">4</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order for these new energies to be converted into improved service and financial results, Carlzon realized that major changes would have to be made in the company&#39;s organization, which at the time was slow, unresponsive to customers and employees, authoritarian and bureaucratic. So he conceived of the now famous idea of turning the organizational pyramid on its heads, viewing the people on the front lines in touch with the customer as the real top of the pyramid and the other levels of management as essentially supporting staff to assist the front lines in carrying our their jobs more effectively to fulfill the mission, values and objectives of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Whether the pyramid was ever actually turned upside down is open to question, but there is no doubt that Carlzon did institute very tangible changes which flattened the SAS organization and had a very real impact on its ability to channel corporate energies. The major change was to shift the focus of the entire company from managing a business to serving customers better. Responsibility for achieving corporate goals was clearly assigned. Many more decisions were delegated to people on the front lines, empowering them with authority to act to improve customer service. The jobs of middle managers and even executives were redefined to focus on the values of service and punctuality.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The new organization was also streamlined by improving systems and reducing paperwork to a minimum. New systems were introduced to make delegation more effective. Everyone was involved in achieving the corporate goals. Procedures were modified to reduce the time required to service planes between flights. A computerized monitoring system was introduced to measure performance on cargo delivery times and flight departure times.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Beyond all these changes, Carlzon focused on one more critically important element in the equation for energizing the company--the skills and attitudes of the people. Unless each individual in the company possessed the skills needed for high performance and an enthusiastic commitment to the corporate goals, there was no way to ensure that the company would achieve those goals. To provide those skills, the company conducted customer service training programs for 12,000 employees. They also introduced cross-training, so that employees could perform more than one job.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.a1yj86qzowoa"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Changes in the organization had a positive impact on employee attitudes. Delegation got people more involved.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">It created an atmosphere in which new ideas could sprout at any level of the company and have a chance to be heard. It &quot;unleashed our employees&#39; creativity through decentralization.&quot;</span><span class="c15">5</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The company instituted awards, celebrations and other forms of social recognition to acknowledge peoples&#39; efforts and contributions to improved performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The results of these efforts: On-time departures improved dramatically. In the first year alone, profits increased by $80 million, against a goal of only $25 million. In a stagnant market, passenger volume increased by 30% in three years. In 1983</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Air Transport World</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">named SAS Airline of the Year, fulfilling Carlzon&#39;s aspiration to make SAS the best.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGY CONVERSION AND DISPERSION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process which Carlzon initiated at SAS closely parallels what Harold Corner did in his company and what we have seen companies of every size and description do to energize themselves to dramatically increase profits and grow rapidly. This process can be thought of as a series of lenses which focus and magnify corporate energies and convert them into material results. The first lens consists of the ideas that give direction to the energies. This lens focuses and converts the energy into force. The second lens consists of the organization which harnesses and controls that force and converts it into a productive power. The third lens is made up of the skills and attitudes of our people which express that power in millions of tiny acts every day--what Carlzon called &quot;moments of truth&quot;. Figure 2 depicts this process of converting energy into material results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about how your company generates, releases, directs and channels the energies of its people.

Moments of Truth, p.38. </span></p><h1 class="c21"><span class="c1 c25">Chapter 5 </span><span class="c1">THE MIRROR IMAGE OF GROWTH</span></h1><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Probably most readers can recall a time, however brief, when everything worked as we have described in the last chapter, a time when the quality of your products or services neared perfection, schedules were met on time, people and activities interacted smoothly and harmoniously-almost without effort-customers were blissfully happy and employees were filled with enthusiasm. Chances are this was also a time when the company was very profitable and growing rapidly as well. If everything was going so well, why didn&#39;t it last? Why is it that most companies find it so difficult to sustain high performance and rapid growth for more than a few years? Why is rapid growth usually such a short-lived phenomenon?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The answers to these questions are relevant to every company that wants to grow rapidly-regardless of whether it has or has not ever grown rapidly in the past and regardless of whether it is or is not growing rapidly at the present moment. For in any case the issue boils down to two questions: What makes rapid growth happen? What makes rapid growth stop?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have already addressed the first of these questions in the last chapter, where we described the process that generates rapid growth. But that process does not occur in every company, and it is not easy to sustain for long periods in any company. Therefore it is not enough that we know what generates growth. We must also understand what impedes and stops it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In our study of fast growing companies, we stumbled on a paradoxical fact that sheds light on these questions. Apart from the list of positive characteristics reported in the last chapter, these companies also reported a set of negative characteristics which almost all of them shared in common. The paradox is that these negative characteristics are exactly opposite and in direct contradiction to the positive ones reported by the very same companies during the same period! Along side high energy, a clear sense of direction, good morale, pride, enthusiasm, teamwork, good systems, good coordination, and continuous training, these same companies reported high levels of stress, fatigue, and burnout, chaos and confusion, breakdown of systems, conflict within the organization, poor coordination and communication, continuous shortage of skilled people and no time for training.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How is it possible for the same companies to report that both enjoyment and stress are very high, that both teamwork and internal conflict are widespread, that systems are at once smooth-running and inadequate, that training is non-stop and non-existent? How is it that such high performing companies should resemble all too closely in some important respects the thousands of ordinary, average companies that are unable to generate rapid and profitable growth? This apparent contradiction contains an important key to why most companies are unable to maintain high rates of growth and why others are unable to grow rapidly in the first place.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The contradictory descriptions reflect the fact that rapid growth is experienced differently in different stages of its progress. Rapid growth usually occurs as a steeply ascending curve followed by a steeply descending curve. The positive characteristics associated with growth-the energy, clear direction, enthusiasm, teamwork, and smooth systems-are commonly associated with the ascending curve when growth is taking off and profits are soaring. As growth gains momentum, enthusiasm rises. People feel excited and eager to meet the challenge. Differences of opinion and preference get pushed into the background as everyone focuses on common goals. There is not time for quarrels or disputes. The organization comes alive and functions at peak performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">NOT ANOTHER ORDER!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As growth accelerates the demands of work on each individual, department, system and operation become proportionately or even geometrically greater. Space becomes scarce, phone lines are constantly busy, computer systems are overloaded. These conditions place more and more demands on the individuals to adjust to or compensate for the shortages by greater personal effort and longer working hours. Stress, fatigue, burnout and internal conflicts increase. Employee turnover rises. Even routine operations-relaying messages, returning phone calls, filing letters, paying bills and salaries (!)-no longer function automatically and require individual attention, because the systems are no longer adequate and there are not enough trained and experienced people. Often the hiring of new people at this stage compounds the difficulty, because the new people need attention and their work needs to be closely supervised in order to ensure that quality is maintained. As stress, pressure and haste increase, so do errors, confusion, and frustration. Quality declines. Service degenerates. Profits fall. The descending curve has begun.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At times like this you can hear people say-sometimes in apparent jest, sometimes in dead seriousness-&quot;Oh, not another new order!&quot; Or depending on the context, a variation on this theme is repeated, such as &quot;Not another new office to open!&quot;, &quot;Not another new customer to serve!&quot; or &quot;Not another new product to develop and produce!&quot; Not surprisingly, life gradually responds to this voiced attitude or silent prayer in one way or another. Customers get frustrated by poor or slow service and go elsewhere with their orders. New products get buried in R &amp; D and never leave the drawing boards. Management cancels plans for expanding into new territories. Growth slows or stops altogether. This explains why out of the 100 companies on INC.&#39;s 1986 list, 37% were growing too slowly to remain on the list in 1987 and 20% reported lower absolute revenues. That is why Mesa Airlines saw their growth rate drop to under 10% last year. That is what prompted Ben Cohen to issue the edict at Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s: &quot;No more growth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGY DISPERSION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process we have been describing is exactly opposite to the one we described in the last chapter. There we saw how companies release and garner all available corporate energies, and then focus, direct, magnify and multiply them to achieve extraordinary results as Harold Corner did at C &amp; J Industries under intense pressure from Japanese competitors and Jan Carlzon did at SAS to transform a substandard airline into one of the best in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter we see how even highly successful companies dissipate the energies that they have released, scatter, disperse and waste them, the way a poorly tuned engine burns excess fuel and dissipates the energy through friction as waste heat. The reverse of the process by which companies convert energy into results is the process by which they disperse those energies in wasteful and unproductive activity. In fact, these are but two expressions, positive and negative, of the same phenomenon. Regardless of whether your company is growing rapidly, levelled off, in a period of decline or near the bottom of the curve, the process of energy conversion and dispersion is the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Figure 3 depicts a company which is well-passed the peak of rapid growth and on the descending curve. Revenues are flat, profits are falling. The company possesses considerable energy but dissipates most of that energy and reaps minimum results for maximum effort. As in the previous diagram, there are three lenses. But in this case the lenses are dispersing the energy rather than focusing and magnifying it. The first lens is direction. Instead of being concentrated on pursuit of corporate values and objectives, the energy is diffracted and scattered. The company does not have clearly defined goals. Its values are vague. There is no formal planning. Various departments pursue conflicting priorities leading to doubts and confusion. The company is rife with rumors. People are skeptical and pessimistic.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 351.13px; height: 450.13px;"><img alt="Corporate Energy Dispersion" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 351.13px; height: 450.13px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Figure 3. Corporate Energy Dispersion</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The second lens is organization. Instead of harnessing and channeling the energy, the energy is being obstructed by lack of clear lines of authority, absence of discipline and constraints on individual initiative. It is being consumed by outmoded, cumbersome, inefficient systems and wasted by duplication of work due to inadequate communication and poor coordination.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The third lens is people. Here the energy is expended inefficiently due to inadequate knowledge and skill and diminished by negative attitudes among employees about the company and its activities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All three of these diffractive lenses are found in most companies. They account for the very poor conversion of energy into results which retards growth and minimizes profits. The efficiency of energy conversion in the average company is not unlike that of the early steam engines of the last century-lots of sound and lots of heat to do a little work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE OTHER END OF THE RAINBOW</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Like all other living things, companies exist and oscillate between two extremes or poles of existence. At one pole they are exploding with a boundless youthful creative energy, expansive, exuberant, lightning quick and responsive, aware of boundless opportunity, performing at peak levels, and growing by leaps and bounds. At the other end they are dull, heavy and slow, overcome by inertia and resistant to change, old in their thoughts and actions, aware only of limitations and obstructions, stagnant and gradually degenerating. In between these two extremes are the companies that have levelled off. They have not yet started up the ascending curve to rapid growth or not yet started down the descending curve to losses and possible extinction.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Whether a company is at one extreme or the other or somewhere in between has relatively little to do with age or size. We have seen very young, small companies behaving like aged invalids and very ancient, large ones behaving like exuberant children. But a company&#39;s position on the spiral of ascent and descent has everything to do with its attitude and the way it utilizes the energies at its disposal.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When an unsuspecting Englishman, Ben Thompson-McCausland, took over as CEO of London Life in 1980, he encountered a company headed straight for the bottom of the barrel. His charge was clear: &quot;London Life is a first class company. Wake it up, but let there be no blood baths.&quot; In his struggle to find an antidote for corporate degeneration, he discovered a formula for eternal corporate youth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imagine a company wearing wire-rimmed bifocals and you get the picture. London Life was founded in 1806, making it one of the oldest mutual life insurance companies in the world. It was a company with some notable strengths-good quality and a good range of products, a record of sound investment performance, loyal employees who took pride in the company&#39;s heritage and past achievements, a tradition of service, and the goodwill of its policyholders.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">But as the new CEO soon discovered, the company was really living in the past and on its past, while slowly but surely heading for the precipice. When Thompson-McCausland assumed charge, he found the company in a serious state of deterioration and drift. &quot;All energy had gone out of the company.&quot; There was an atmosphere of complacency and inertia-no deadlines and no sense of urgency. &quot;The company was suffused with a feeling of sleepy security.&quot;</span><span class="c15">6</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There was no sense of direction either. Values like service, which the company had prided itself on in the past, had lost all meaning. The quality of service had been declining for years. Responses to enquiries were slow. Employees reacted to customer complaints with excuses and defensiveness, or did not bother answering them at all! There was no planning and no budgeting. New ideas were discouraged, good ideas were shot down.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The organization was fragmented and highly bureaucratic. It was divided into several autonomous empires. There were no clear lines of authority. Status and security were given greater importance than productivity. In one department there were five employees, four of them supervisors! Systems were sloppy and outdated. Coordination was poor. Each branch office functioned according to its own standards and procedures.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">People felt secure in their jobs and were well-paid, so there was very little staff turnover. There were no targets set for individuals or departments. No one was evaluated or held accountable for achieving results. Therefore talents were ignored. &quot;The idea of standards of performance was completely alien.&quot; Morale was low. People felt defensive and afraid. Gossip and quarrels were rife. There was an anti-training attitude in the company. Training for managers was non-existent. Selling was considered a dirty word.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For the previous 20 years, the company had been gradually losing market share to the competition. In 1976 alone the company lost a major government account and 44% of its most profitable premium income. A 1980 industry survey showed London Life&#39;s expense ratios were the highest of the nine companies examined and dangerously out of line with the rest of the industry. In other words, London Life was a company whose lenses were cloudy, full of cataracts, and all out of shape.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What would you do if you were in Thompson-McCausland&#39;s position-assuming, of course, that it was too late to back out of the assignment?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">RESTORING LIFE TO LONDON</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ben had an intuitive understanding that energy was the key, that without energy he could not accomplish anything. So the very first thing he did was to start moving around briskly through the company, meeting everybody, taking interest in every operation, speaking enthusiastically, asking thousands of questions-even running up and down the stairs. He made himself a living example and embodiment of energy, dynamism and speed and set a demanding pace for every activity in which he got involved. &quot;Energy was the one thing I concentrated on. It was a charismatic approach, energy and example.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.tzf5cdy1asc2"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then he set a new direction for the company. He started talking about change and growth, about improving performance and rejuvenating the company, about restoring London Life to the heights it had occupied in the past. He opened up communications, encouraged suggestions from all quarters, and challenged pessimistic attitudes. He asked senior managers to identify the company&#39;s values and define clear standards for how those values should express in action. He then extended the process to middle managers and eventually to groups of employees at all levels of the company to build awareness and acceptance of those values. He got everyone involved in thinking and talking about how to improve the company, in developing performance standards and contributing their ideas on how to achieve them. A consensus gradually emerged. A previously unknown energy, enthusiasm and excitement began to surface in this once placid and lethargic company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Top management formulated a new mission: &quot;To be the best run life office in the land.&quot; They set quantitative targets for growth-40% a year, compared to an industry average of 15%. The plan was &quot;received with horror.&quot;</span><span class="c15">7</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Time deadlines were set for every routine activity. Meeting schedules were rigorously enforced to ensure that too much time and energy were not spent in talking rather than doing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then he and his staff turned to look at the organization. It was immediately clear that the existing structure was inadequate for the task. Already managers were having problems directing and utilizing the new energy for productive purposes. People now became easily frustrated by conditions they had quietly endured for years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">So they set about creating a new simplified structure, abolishing the dotted lines and devious routes by which people reported, got their work done and exercised control over others. Many supervisory positions were redefined and assigned clear operational responsibilities. Branches were given a much higher level of decision-making authority and greater freedom for initiative. Frequent meetings were instituted to foster coordination and teamwork, especially between the head office and the branches. Ben found that &quot;the new structure gave rise to a sense of renaissance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The initial response to these efforts was extraordinary. Against a target of 40% growth, new business increased by 87% in 1982. Morale improved dramatically. People worked hard and happily. The company began to grow again. It was on the upward spiral.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But it soon became evident that much more needed to be done in order to sustain that growth. The organization was still a constraint and a stumbling block. Systems were quickly overloaded by the increased volumes and rendered useless. Management instituted a complete review of the company&#39;s systems and an effort to upgrade them to handle the growing volume of business quickly and smoothly. They instituted quality circles to get everyone involved in making improvements. There was even a circle for messengers and file clerks, which came up with some good suggestions to streamline the process of file retrieval.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The greater the efforts they took, the greater the improvement in performance. Yet they always seemed to be chasing an elusive target. For the more they improved, the more business grew and the more needed to be done to keep up with the increasing volume of work. For this reason, it took a full three years to bring down customer response times to the desired level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet for all their efforts, it was clear to Ben and his team that something more was needed. The higher quality standards, sales goals and volumes of work not only strained the company&#39;s systems to the limit, it put enormous demands on the skills of the people as well. So they introduced a comprehensive training program to impart new and higher skills to people at all levels of the company, from senior management to secretaries and receptionists. At the top, the company instituted a two year corporate development program to improve managerial and interpersonal skills with an emphasis on participation and teamwork. The program released tremendous energy, revealed hidden talents and generated a sense of fulfillment. At lower levels, the program covered a broad array of skills ranging from time management, decision-making and assertiveness training for subordinates to creative thinking, report writing and how to manage your in-tray. Improving people&#39;s skills was highly motivating. Thompson-McCausland found that &quot;training released much more energy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ben removed the bifocals and restored clear vision to this once aging company. Gradually this sombre and formal corporate personality was transformed into a youthful, dynamic and exciting company again-as it had been in its prime many decades earlier-and a rapidly growing one too. From 1980 to 1984, London Life&#39;s new premium business increased 4.5 times, its total income and investment fund both doubled, and its expense ratio declined by 41%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">REFOCUSING THE LENSES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The conditions Thompson-McCausland found at London Life are not as uncommon as we may like to believe.</span><a id="id.l7n86sf49xfm"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">They are quite similar to the conditions that Lee Iacocca encountered when he took over at Chrysler in the late 1970s, of which he later remarked: &quot;If I had the slightest idea of what lay ahead for me when I joined up with Chrysler, I wouldn&#39;t have gone over there for all the money in the world.&quot;</span><span class="c15">8</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">The situation he encountered was so de-energizing that instead of thinking how to double the company he was literally seeing double! Yet Iacocca was able to reverse the lenses and convert $3.3 billion in losses which Chrysler accumulated from 1978 to 1981 into $3.3 billion in profit over the next three years and to double the revenues of what was already a $12 billion company in the process.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In actual fact, these conditions exist to some extent in every company. Like the lenses in our eyes, the lenses of a company have to be continuously refocused on a constantly changing and moving world both outside and within the company. This task can never be complete, so long as a company wants to keep growing and surpassing its previous performance. And regardless of its age, as soon as it stops wanting growth, it embarks on the descending curve which London Life had ridden nearly to the bottom, before refocusing its lenses and reversing the direction of its energy flow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GROWTH IS AN ENDLESS CHALLENGE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Even after the dramatic turnaround of SAS, Jan Carlzon found that the job was not over. In winning international recognition, 1983 was a year of attainment for SAS and for Carlzon.</span><a id="id.t7l3m07n7l1x"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">But for Carlzon, it was followed in 1984 by &quot;a year of agony.&quot;</span><span class="c15">9</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.9szue6cyyo42"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The problem was that SAS had achieved all that it had set out to achieve...and more. Carlzon explains how by fulfilling and exceeding its goals, SAS had inadvertently rendered itself directionless once again. The first lens got out of focus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&quot;I was quickly learning yet another lesson about running a business organization: when you reach your goal, you become a prisoner of success...Between 1981 and 1984 all our forces were aligned, and each and every person was striving to surpass his previous best efforts. But now we had arrived at our objective-before we had given much thought to what we wanted to accomplish next. The absence of new goals was producing some negative effects at SAS. The atmosphere of togetherness was eroding. The purpose of our work began to be questioned frequently. And our employees&#39; newfound energy began to be redirected toward narrower and more personal objectives...By establishing our original goal, we had placed a demand on our employees. But now that there was no goal, a kind of reversal had set in. We had unleashed new energy, new motivation; with the goal achieved and the motivation still there, people began setting their own individual goals, scattering in all directions and making different demands of the company. It was a graphic illustration of the need for top management to direct all forces toward a common goal.&quot;</span><span class="c15">10</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And so Carlzon set about refocusing the lenses again by launching what he calls &quot;the second wave&quot;. He established a more challenging direction for the corporate energies-to make SAS the most efficient airline in Europe by 1990 in preparation for deregulation of the commercial airlines there. Then he introduced further changes in the organization to further flatten and decentralize it, redefining the roles of middle and top management and further empowering people on the front lines.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The SAS experience dramatically illustrates the power of the process of energy conversion. It also points to the inadequacy of a limited goal like doubling. So if you have not yet chosen to triple or quadruple your business, set your sights higher!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ACTION PLAN FOR CORPORATE ENERGY FLOW</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What about the three lenses in your company?

Are you giving clear direction to those energies through commitment to values and objectives? Does the organization effectively harness and channel those energies for productive work?

Where do we want to go? and How are we going to get there? Thus far we have been primarily concerned with the first of these questions-where are we. We have looked at the five components of your business and raised questions to help you evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of these powerful engines. We have also examined the process of energy conversion and raised questions to help you determine how effectively your company generates, directs and utilizes the energies at its disposal to achieve maximum results in terms of productivity, profitability and revenue growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now we come to the second basic planning question-where do we want to go. The answer to this question sets the direction for channeling corporate energies. It also plays a crucial role in determining how much energy is available for direction. The higher our goals, the greater the energy they release. Energy is released when we become aware of a greater unrealized possibility and make a firm decision to convert that possibility into a reality. Awareness of the opportunities available for growth is the first step toward achieving them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter we will be focusing on opportunities that exist in the external environment for the growth of your company. In subsequent chapters, we will examine some of the potentials buried within your company that also represent untold opportunities for its growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">According to common conception the true entrepreneur is one who has a vision of an opportunity which others do not see. It is that vision which inspires his thinking, excites his imagination, releases his energies and propels him into action. A vision of opportunity is the basis for all high achievement.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AMRE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Steve Bedowitz and Robert Levin of AMRE had such a vision of the home improvements industry. Levin explained: &quot;Steve and I saw that nobody had grown big in this industry. Most of the guys were salesmen or carpenters.&quot; Like Art Bartlett, founder of Century 21, in the real estate industry and Harry Patten in the land business, Bedowitz and Levin saw an opportunity in a fragmented industry composed of thousands of small mom-and-pop operators. In 1981 AMRE got its first license to sell siding under the Sears name in Austin, Texas. Steve then realized that &quot;here is a vehicle that is easily expandable. The name Sears gave us the little extra that made it easier for us to expand across the country, so that&#39;s when the idea came to us to specialize in just a few products but take it national.&quot; The company quickly established operations throughout Texas and neighboring states and then expanded across the country.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Awareness of an opportunity is essential, but awareness alone is not enough. There must also be a compelling urge for achievement. That urge or determination to achieve releases our energies for effective action. As we said in the first chapter, you must really want it. Says Levin:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;The real difference, the reason why we made it was our goals. The typical business person&#39;s goal is to make enough money for themselves. Our goal on a continuing basis was not how much money could we make, but how big could we grow the company. There is a big difference. We both always wanted to build a big company and we set out to do it. From the beginning we have always set goals. Short term, long term. We&#39;ve amazed ourselves at how close we&#39;ve come to hitting them. Setting the long term goals and living with those is the real secret of any good organization. We still have aspirations, things we want to accomplish.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Nor are their goals limited to being the dominant force in the $5 billion dollar siding industry. Siding is only a small part of the $100 billion home improvements industry. And home improvements is really just one of the many fields in which they can express their organizational capabilities. As Bedowitz explained, &quot;In essence, we are not a siding company. We are a direct consumer marketing company with many other potential fields for our growth. My goal is to be a Fortune 500 company by 1992.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE TWIN KEYS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Back in the 1960s Fred Smith had a vision, which legend says he first described in a college essay. His vision was:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;to build a transportation company that would be to the automated, computerized, technologically-based industries of today what the railroads were to the industries of the late nineteenth century, what the truck lines were to the traditional manufacturers of the 30s and the 50s; that is, to be the primary artery of today&#39;s high value-added industries, the clipper ships of the computer age. My goal when I started the company was to create a totally unique transportation system that I felt was the total underpinning of the computer age. I mean it was a huge vision and it still is. It hasn&#39;t changed one iota.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In an industry dominated by giant UPS since 1907, Smith was able to see tremendous opportunity where others saw none, because he understood the significance of changes in life style. He saw that the pace of modern life was accelerating rapidly and that people were no longer satisfied with one week or even three day parcel delivery. By simply abridging that time to overnight, he founded an new multi-billion dollar industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For 16 years Smith&#39;s vision has guided the growth of Federal Express. That vision consists of two parts-a perception and an aspiration. He saw a possibility and he wanted to achieve it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;I believe Federal Express will be far and away the largest transportation company in the world. Now we&#39;re probably number 8 or 9, but I don&#39;t have any question about the fact that we&#39;re going to be bigger than all of them. My unfulfilled aspirations are twofold: first, to do all over the world basically what we have done for the United States; and second, to make Federal Express a flawless organization in terms of the quality it produces.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Smith&#39;s perception has set the direction for the growth of Federal Express over the last 16 years and will continue to do so well into the next century. His determination to realize what he perceived as possible has been the catalyst which released and set in motion his energies and the energies of his people. That commitment continues to propel the company forward.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Smith&#39;s awareness and aspiration fixed the boundaries or limits on what the company could accomplish, but its actual achievements have depended on his ability to inspire others in the company to believe in and seek to fulfill his vision.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;I think that the most important thing that we have done here at Federal Express is to make sure that everybody in the company shares in the vision of this institution. The vast majority of people want to do something that they feel is important in their lives. One of their primary motivations is to be on a quest, to be on a mission.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The leader&#39;s vision determines what is possible, but his or her ability to generate acceptance of the vision in people at all levels of the company-to create a consensus of thought and enthusiastic support for action culminating in the wholesale release of collective energies-determines to what extent that vision will actually be realized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The leader must have an awareness of opportunity and an aspiration to realize it. These two result in a commitment to pursue the opportunity. When that commitment is complete, it expresses as an infectious and overflowing enthusiasm. That enthusiasm releases the energy of the leader and sparks the imagination of key people in the company. When the leader succeeds in communicating the vision and in creating a commitment and consensus among others in favor of pursuing the opportunity, their enthusiasm and energies are also released and the whole company is propelled into action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">A perception of opportunity and a will to achieve it are the twin keys that unlock the powers of rapid growth.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">If the perception is narrow and circumscribed-if we fail to see that there are infinite opportunities within and around us-or if the aspiration is limited, if the goal we set is not high enough to keep us stretching, so will be our achievement.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HUNTING FOR TREASURE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">In Alexander Dumas&#39;</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The Count of Monte Cristo</span><span class="c3">, a poor innocent sailor is thrown into prison where he is befriended by a learned priest who gives him the map to a fabulous treasure buried on a deserted island. After the priest&#39;s death, the sailor escapes from the prison, recovers the treasure and become one of the wealthiest men in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We write with conviction about the opportunity for every company to grow rapidly and profitably, because every company has not one, but five treasures within its reach and available for exploitation-not on some far off island-but right in its own back yard. We referred to these treasures earlier as the five engines of a business. We have also sighted examples of companies in crisis which have successfully tapped these opportunities for growth, like Chrysler Corporation and C&amp;J Industries did in the face of intense competition from Japan and SAS did in a stagnant commercial airline market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What are these opportunities? Where do they come from? How can we identify them?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Life is continuously throwing up new opportunities in every industry for those who have the eyes to perceive them. It does not require a visionary&#39;s genius, just an open mind and a will to see. New opportunities are constantly emerging because society is continuously evolving, and the rate of social development is greater today than at any prior time in recorded history. Every change that occurs as part of this process has direct or indirect impact on virtually every aspect of social life and, therefore, on virtually every business as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Earlier we described the five engines as the essential components of a business, but they can also be viewed as the five basic social resources which each business draws upon in order to constitute itself and to grow-capital, technology, market, people and organization. Each significant change in society influences one or more of these five components, adding some new dimension to it or altering the way it functions. The effort to become aware of these changes and identify their significance generates a perception of new business opportunities. This perception is worth more than all the capital invested in a business, ten times more. For that perception creates capital and the fruits of capital-profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">During the 19th century, capital was considered synonymous with business. The barons of industry in those days were known as capitalists. Countries with established capital markets and companies that could amass capital flourished. As the last century came to a close, a second engine-technology-became increasingly important. Rapid advances and revolutions in technology have been the most important engine of industrial development during the last eight decades. Even today they continue to be a powerful force for change, a prodigious generator of new opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But now more than any time in the past, there are many other social changes taking place which influence these five engines and generate new opportunities faster than we can perceive or respond to them. All the five engines are very actively producing fabulous treasures for those who see and seek them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ordinarily we view the changes taking place around us from the perspective of our present needs and activities. We take note of those with immediate and direct impact on what and where we are today. We ignore many important but apparently unrelated trends because we do not see how they will or could impact on the five social resources which constitute our business. If we really want to understand the full significance and potential of these changes, we must step out of our present context for a moment, cast off our mental set, and look freshly at what is really going on. Every development in society completely redraws the whole map of the future and creates new opportunities all around us.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is worth the time and effort to try to understand the forces that create new opportunities-worth its weight in gold. Stop for a while and think about it. What social changes in the past have created new opportunities for companies in your industry? What further changes are taking place today which may generate new opportunities for your industry in the future?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Technological change was not always as warmly welcomed as it is today. When the windmill was first introduced in Holland centuries ago, the church considered it a sacrilege for anyone but God to direct the wind. The priests actually instructed their parishes not to use wind-milled grain. When the first British clock manufacturer tried marketing wall clocks in India 150 years ago, the company found it difficult to convince customers that the clocks really served a useful function. As a last resort, the company installed clocks free of charge in customers&#39; homes for a one month trial. By the time they came back the next month to remove the clocks, most consumers were sold on the new device. In the late 1940s, a brilliant but unknown inventor named Chester Carlson developed an ingenious black box capable of reproducing the image of a printed page on plain paper-a process he called xerography. Carlson took his marvelous invention to more than 20 of the leading manufacturers in the U.S., companies like IBM, General Electric and RCA, and offered it for sale. Everywhere he was turned down because the companies did not see a market for the product. Finally a company named Haloid, forerunner of Xerox Corporation, decided to stake its future on a &quot;chance&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Today the customer is far more ready and willing to accept new products and technologies, even if they are unorthodox and unusual, provided that they have some intrinsic value and utility. The number of new products and processes being developed is increasing exponentially. The time from invention in the laboratory to acceptance in the marketplace has shrunk from decades to months. These trends signify that more and better opportunities are being thrown up for grabs every year, every month, almost every day.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Listen Up, a high-end, audio-video retailer based in Denver, was one of the first in the country to recognize the potential of a new technology for home entertainment, the compact audio disc. At a time back in 1983 when CDs were not even available for sale in the U.S. market, the founders of Listen Up, Walt Stinson and Steve Weiner, flew to Japan to see the technology and carried back suitcases full of CDs to sell in their store. The new technology spurred the explosive growth of their business. Stinson can vividly recall the time between 1983 and 1986, when revenues rose from $6 million to $12 million. He suddenly found that &quot;we had a tiger by the tail. We doubled our revenues in three years. We didn&#39;t mean for that to happen. That&#39;s too fast, I believe. It was too fast for us. But we got into something that we couldn&#39;t control. We grabbed the tiger by the tail and hung on.&quot; Stinson and Weiner saw an opportunity around the corner, which the large record and hi-fi chains failed to see. Then they actively sought out that opportunity and converted it into growth-and gold.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In virtually every industry, the rapid development of new technologies generates opportunities for new and improved services as well as new products. Computers are enabling companies to network directly with their customers and provide them with new services. Federal Express is installing terminals in their customers&#39; facilities which enable customers to order and track parcel deliveries and even handle freight billing. Gartner Group is developing a system that will enable customers to get up-to-the-minute information on important changes in the computer industry by on-line time sharing and electronic mail. Expeditors International is providing customs clearance services for its customers via computer, and so on.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about your industry and your business? What are the technological developments that have created opportunities for new or improved products or services in your industry over the past decade? What technological developments are now emerging which represent new opportunities in the immediate future? What other developments are on the horizon which hold promise down the line?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">STAYING IN STYLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Technological development is still a very important engine of new opportunities, but it is not the sole source. Today both business and the consumer have been trained to understand and recognize the significance of technological changes and to welcome them with anticipation. But our society is not nearly as astute in grasping the significance of changes in other spheres of life.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of the most sweeping social changes of the past quarter century is the increasing demand for speed, which Fred Smith capitalized on to build Federal Express. Companies in virtually every industry-from fast food and shoe repairing to containerized shipping and mold making- are discovering new implications and new opportunities arising from the increasing importance of speed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.ikdvc0t6r88k"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&quot;Healthy, wealthy and wise&quot; goes the saying. Many companies have been wise enough to see an opportunity for great wealth in the American public&#39;s growing preoccupation with health and exercise. Reebok multiplied its revenues nearly 100-fold in four years, growing from $13 million in 1983 to $1.4 billion in 1987, by recognizing the significance of a life style change in its industry.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Co-founder Paul Fireman explains:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;There was a social change going on which nobody had noticed. We realized that the aerobics craze was for real and that there was a huge untapped market of women seeking both comfort and style. The industry was only focusing on jogging shoes. It wasn&#39;t growing with the customer.&quot;</span><span class="c15 c17">11</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Reebok&#39;s stylish recreational shoes have attracted some 20 million new customers, many of whom have purchased four or more pairs in different colors.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The phenomenon of the working woman is a social change with far-reaching implications for businesses in such varied fields as processed food, day care and garment manufacturing. Liz Claiborne Inc. recognized an opportunity resulting from the increasing number of working women and decided to specialize in designing stylish clothes for them.</span><a id="id.ycw6r79k4dmp"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&quot;We knew we wanted to clothe women in the work force,&quot; says co-founder and vice chairman Jerry Chazen. &quot;We saw a niche where no pure player existed. What we didn&#39;t know was how many customers were out there.&quot;</span><span class="c15">12</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Over the last eight years Liz Claiborne&#39;s sales have grown at an average compounded annual rate of more than 40%, while earnings have soared tenfold.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Charles Lazarus saw a different opportunity arising out of the same social change. He realized that the busy working woman would like a place to shop for her children that was quick, easy and relative inexpensive. So he founded the Toys &quot;R&quot; Us chain of warehouse style stores, which offer a much wider range of playthings than traditional department stores. By 1988 the company was operating 350 stores with sales of over $3.1 billion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What recent social or life style changes have generated new opportunities in your industry? What social trends could represent opportunities for you in the future?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Society is continuously generating new, more complex and efficient types of organization. The explosive growth of the fast food industry initiated by McDonald&#39;s in the mid 1950s was fueled by a new type of organization-the franchise restaurant chain. Since then franchising has stimulated the growth of an incredible variety of industries ranging from health clubs to home security.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Earlier we described how AMRE became a dominant force nationally in the long established home improvements industry, which previously had consisted primarily of local, mom and pop operations. When the company first proposed to extend its collaboration with Sears outside of Texas, Sears rejected the proposal on the grounds that a larger operation could not be effectively managed, as several past failures had proven. Yet AMRE persisted and given the chance, showed that it could succeed where others had failed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE accomplished its coup in just eight years by creating a highly centralized and efficiently run marketing operation to direct and coordinate the activity of local sales offices and warehouses throughout the country. Homeowners responding to AMRE&#39;s advertisements call into a central office, which qualifies each potential customer and then assigns them to a particular sales office. Every morning the manager of each branch office receives an electronic message listing the details of potential customers. The branch office then schedules two appointments that day for each sales person in the office.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Expeditors International and Patten Corporation saw similar opportunities in two other primarily mom and pop industries, freight forwarding and selling rural land. They tapped these opportunities by developing organizations that could operate efficiently on a larger scale. Minit International successfully took on an established shoe repair industry worldwide and rose to a globally dominant position in twenty years by introducing a new type of organization into the industry based on thousands of decentralized service units run by entrepreneurial managers and supported by central manufacturing, distribution, training and marketing facilities in each country.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Just-In-Time</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">is an organizational development which is creating opportunities in a wide range of industries. Federal Express operates a Parts Bank in Memphis to stock products and replacement parts for large manufacturers and mail order catalog retailers. Many companies have reduced or eliminated their warehouses, utilizing the Fed Ex system to store and delivery their products from point to point for sale or use precisely when needed. Parts Bank customers can send replacement parts or products via Fed Ex for delivery by 10:30 am the next morning practically anywhere in the country.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A central part of Nedlloyd Line&#39;s strategic plan for the 1990s is a similar organizational strategy for providing just-in-time logistical services for large volume shippers. When American manufacturers ship their products to Europe, Nedlloyd will assume complete responsibility for bulk transport of products by ship, rail and truck on both sides of the Atlantic. They will then stock products for the shipper in Nedlloyd-operated warehouses and ship individual consignments to European customers as directed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organizational developments are also affecting the relationship between manufacturers and their vendors. There is a shake-down going on in American industry today. In order to stay competitive, many American manufacturers are reducing the number of vendors they work with quite drastically, but increasing the scope and extent of their dependence on those that pass muster. Companies like GE, McDonnell Douglas and Kodak are working with vendors of parts, components and tools to develop closer, more synergistic and long term relations. Critical suppliers are being included as part of the product development team and given input into product design at an early stage. Some major manufacturers are directly linking up their computer systems with those of vendors, so that communication of information and design specifications is greatly facilitated. Others are demanding guarantees from their vendors of on-time delivery and quality in return for guaranteed orders. Many vendors see these organizational developments as threats. Others, like C &amp; J Industries, welcome the changes and view them as opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CHANGES IN LAW AND POLITICS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Deregulation has been a mother of many business opportunities during the past decade. The survival and phenomenal growth of Federal Express was made possible by deregulation of the air cargo industry, which Smith campaigned for vigorously in the late 1970s. The proliferation of commuter airlines like Mesa, regional airlines like America Air West, and the doubling of airline passenger volume in five years were also a direct result of airline deregulation, which has been so successful that it is slated for introduction in Europe by the earlier 1990s. Deregulation of interstate trucking created the occasion for P.A.M. to enter a highly competitive business dominated by established giants and grow to $70 million in seven years. Deregulation in telecommunications gave birth to a litter of thriving Baby Bell companies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Increased regulation can also stimulate new opportunities. The hazardous waste industry has expanded very rapidly in the 1980s due to the plethora of new legislation regulating the disposal of hazardous industrial wastes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Political and economic events outside our country have a far greater impact than ever before. Most of us are conscious of external changes that threaten to force changes in the way we do business. But how many are equally aware of the external changes that could generate lucrative opportunities, if we take the effort to change our way of doing business before we are forced to by circumstances? How many companies have seriously considered what business opportunities could be generated for them out of</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Perestroika</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">in the Soviet Union, the liberalization of the Eastern bloc, the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq, the economic unification of the European Economic Community in 1992, the transfer of power in Hong Kong in 1997, the rapid development of future industrial giants like Brazil, China and India, etc.?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Traditionally, the American tool and die industry has catered almost exclusively to domestic manufacturers and always assumed its foreign competitors would do likewise. Now all the rules of international competition have changed and the devaluation of the dollar has opened up worldwide opportunities for U.S. toolmakers. Yet in a survey we conducted, very few said that they saw exports as an important opportunity for them. But a few companies in the industry are aggressively exploring foreign markets and meeting with considerably success. Last year Enpro Systems of Houston, a $9 million manufacturing and fabrication business, appointed its first international sales representative and committed $100,000 for marketing overseas. In less than twelve months the company has established worldwide agents for its industrial values and booked several million dollars in foreign orders.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Twenty years ago, even ten years ago, how many really foresaw the positive impact which the Pacific Rim would have on their own businesses today-on the quality, cost, and delivery time for manufactured products, on the demand for tools and components, on the price of consumer products, on foreign exchange rates and exports, on financial markets and investment opportunities, on foreign investments in U.S. companies, manufacturing facilities and real estate, etc.? The founders of Expeditors International did. They recognized that the growth of imports from the Pacific Rim countries meant more incoming airfreight. In their eyes that translated into a lucrative opportunity for freight forwarders and consolidators. Starting from scratch in 1979, Expeditors has grown to become the largest air freight forwarder from the Pacific Rim with revenues of over $147 million.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the impact of changing legal and political conditions on the world around you and the potential for converting them into opportunities for the growth of your business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">VISION PAYS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Awareness is capital. Perception is profit. Newly emerging opportunities are like waves emerging out of the ocean. Companies that perceive and exploit an opportunity are like surfers taking the wave for a ride. It is all a question of timing and positioning. Figure 4 depicts a wave of opportunity and three companies in the industry. The company at the top perceived the wave just as it was rising out of the ocean, positioned itself properly, and was carried forward and upward by the momentum of the wave to 1000 times its original position, like Apple Computers, Federal Express, Liz Claiborne and Reebok, which saw before others the newly emerging opportunities in their industries and rode the wave on its crest to a 1,000 times their original size.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 313.00px;"><img alt="Wave of Opportunity" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 500.00px; height: 313.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3"><br></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Figure 4. Wave of Opportunity</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company positioned in the middle was not the first to perceive the emerging opportunity, but was quick to follow the lead of the pioneer. This company has been carried upward to ten times its original size, like Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s in the gourmet ice cream market, Mesa Airlines, and hundreds of other companies which appear on the INC. list for a year or two.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company at the bottom missed the boat and was left behind. Either it was too slow to perceive the opportunity or it failed to heed the advice of its customers or the example of its competitors, or it perceived the opportunity as a threat and chose to ignore it, hoping it would go away.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What are the opportunities now emerging in your industry as the result of developments in technology, life style, social attitude, organization, law or politics, devaluation of the dollar, etc.? Where is your company positioned on the wave of opportunities that have emerged in your industry? Is it a visionary and a pioneer? If not, does it at least respond quickly and adeptly to the example of the industry leaders? What are the national or international events which may create new opportunities for your company in the future?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Some companies may think that they are too small to be affected or benefitted by national or international developments. Then what about state and local developments? Some small companies may feel that they are fully dependent on their large industrial customers and have no destiny of their own. Then think about how these factors could generate opportunities for your customers and ask how you can also take advantage of the opportunities available to them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is no shortage of opportunity. As Lee Southard, President of Vipont Research put it: &quot;There have always been more opportunities out there than there are people who can actually go after them and master them and make them work. What we need in this country is more people that can capitalize on opportunities, not more opportunities.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ARE YOU READY?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are a number of things your company can and should do to foster the awareness and develop the perception of newly emerging opportunities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">1. Encourage your customers to speak out and listen to what they say. What do they like? What would they like better? What are their problems?

Ibid.,p.30.</span></p><h1 class="c21"><span class="c1 c25">Chapter 7 </span><span class="c1">THE POWER OF VALUES</span></h1><p class="c10 c2"><span class="c18 c6 c25 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the last chapter we looked at some of the opportunities for rapid growth which are constantly being generated by changes in the external environment. These changes create enough potentials for any company to double. But the opportunities created by these external treasures pale into insignificance when compared with the vast riches which every company can unearth within itself. The key to those riches is values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The word value is often used to describe something rather vague and nebulous, a grandiose idea or ideal, a corporate ethic or philosophy. But when we use the word, we mean something very different-something very real, very concrete and very powerful. Values possess power, a phenomenal power-the power to energize a company for rapid growth in revenues and profits-and this is a power which is fully available and accessible to every company. Like opportunities in the external environment, the only essential conditions are: you must be aware of their enormous potentials and you must really want to tap them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Earlier we said that companies direct their energies by focusing on the achievement of corporate goals. The goal may be to achieve a quantitative target for units produced and sold or dollars of revenue and profit. The goal may also be to improve the quality of performance-to do work better, faster, more efficiently, more safely, more systematically, with improved communication or coordination, in a manner more pleasing to customers or more satisfying to employees, etc. These qualitative goals are what we mean by corporate values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">BANG &amp; OLUFSEN</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Robert Cavalco discovered the power of values a few years ago after he took over as CEO of Bang &amp; Olufsen of America. BOA is the U.S. subsidiary of a $300 million Danish electronics manufacturer, known throughout the world for its technically sophisticated and superbly designed audio and video home entertainment systems. Bang &amp; Olufsen is the Mercedes and BMW of hi-fi.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Cavalco joined BOA, he found the company facing fierce competition from Japanese electronics manufacturers. As a result sales had remained flat at around $22 million for the past three years. Cavalco started looking for some chemistry to turn a difficult situation into an opportunity for growth and he found one, not outside in the marketplace, but within the company itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The opportunity he hit upon was a value-customer service. He decided that it was not enough that his company offered the most elegant products on the market or offered acoustical quality equal to the world&#39;s best. BOA would offer the most elegant and best quality service to its customers as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Having identified an opportunity, he took the idea to his four senior executives and shared his thoughts and enthusiasm with them. Customer service was something that they could share and get excited about. Then he carried it to his employees at BOA&#39;s Chicago headquarters and spoke with missionary zeal about the company&#39;s new direction. He talked with the company&#39;s sales representatives and customer service representatives, but he did not stop there. He got virtually everyone in the company involved, even the shipping and warehouse crews, the accounts receivable and credit personnel. He brought in a consultant to work with groups of employees to define what customer service should mean to the company and elicit their ideas on how to improve it. The idea seemed to appeal to everyone and it caught on.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cavalco and his management team spent the next few months travelling hectically around the U.S. meeting their customers and asking them, &quot;What can we do to help and serve you better?&quot; He and his team listened carefully and responded immediately wherever possible. They took action to liberalize the company&#39;s merchandise return policy, offer more flexible credit terms where appropriate, increase the speed of order processing, and improve the quality of packing. They sent out a travelling sales training program and trained 1,500 dealer sales people. Cavalco took many other steps to improve communication with his dealers. He even sent his chief financial officer to give free consulting services to electronics retailers who needed advice on how to manage their own companies better.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The immediate result of these initial efforts was visible to everyone who knew and dealt with the company. Though few tangible changes had yet been made in the company&#39;s policies or practices, these efforts generated tremendous energy and excitement. Employees became more active and enthusiastic. Customers began to look on the company differently, as a friend and a partner. By the end of the year, Bang &amp; Olufsen was rated the best customer service company by specialty home entertainment retailers. And after three years of no growth, the company&#39;s sales grew by 35%. That is the power of a value.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">POWER OF VALUES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are seven important reasons why values have power.</span></p><a id="id.y2y21741cpu4"></a><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values Release Energy</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Values release energy because they motivate people. &quot;People get far more excited about doing something as well as it can be done than about doing something adequately,&quot; says Steve Jobs.</span><span class="c15">13</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">They motivate people to work together collectively to improve overall corporate performance. Everyone likes to be part of a company that is known for its quality or its service, its integrity or its fairness, its friendliness or its contribution to the community. People feel pride and satisfaction in being with an organization that has quality and class.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">People at London Life Insurance had gradually lost that sense of pride and satisfaction over the years as the quality of performance slowly deteriorated, so slowly that they still perceived the company as high quality long after that quality had begun to fade. After Ben Thompson-McCausland arrived, people became conscious of what the company had been in the past and could be again in the future. They took up the challenge to re-establish the company&#39;s great traditions. Once divided departments and groups started working together as a team to establish and achieve higher standards for speed, quality of work, customer satisfaction and communication. &quot;We took a deliberate decision to commit ourselves to the values,&quot; Thompson-McCausland says. The focus on values released tremendous energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Values also motivate people to improve individual performance on their own jobs. Profit and revenue growth may be powerful motivating goals for the owners of a company, the CEO and senior management. But what does accountant, the receptionist or the warehouse clerk have to do with profit? Even if the company has a profit sharing plan, many employees cannot easily see a direct relationship between their activities and corporate profits. But everyone can relate to values, because values apply to every job, every activity, every operation in a company. Achieving a high level of performance on any value is self-gratifying, self-rewarding, even when it is not linked to compensation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At London Life everyone got involved and felt the personal impact of the focus on values, even the file clerks and secretaries. Employees worked together in groups to identify which values needed to be strengthened and the best way to do it. This gave each individual a sense of participation and ownership in the values. Once a consensus had been established, each person had a responsibility for increasing the quality of performance on his or her own job. The values became a personal challenge to every employee to improve execution of work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values promote non-stop expansion</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every sales manager knows the power of setting targets for a sales force. The mere fact of establishing a quantifiable objective propels people to achieve it, on condition that they perceive it as a realistic target. But as Jan Carlzon found out, quantifiable objectives motivate only until you reach them. Once you achieve or exceed them, as SAS achieved and exceeded its three year profit target the very first year, they no longer possess the power to raise performance further. That is why SAS leveled off after its initial explosive surge.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Values, on the other hand, are not subject to this limitation, for they can never be fully and finally achieved. The achievement of better quality and improved teamwork today is no assurance that they will still be better tomorrow, any more than cleaning a room today ensures that it will remain clean tomorrow. Values are like ever-receding or never-ending goals. The higher the values, the more the energy and effort required to achieve and sustain them. The more you pursue them, the greater the energy they release and put into action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values are precise measures of performance</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Goals are measures by which we evaluate our performance and strive to improve it. The effectivity of any measure is directly related to the quality of the measuring instrument. The finer and more perfect the result we seek to achieve, the more precise must be the instrument we use to evaluate our performance. We can use a yard stick to measure the length of a room or a bolt of cloth without much difficulty, but the same instrument is unsuitable for measuring the precision of a small ball-bearing or the dimensional accuracy of a hair-thin filament. For that we need a micrometer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">High corporate performance requires perfect precision in decision-making, product quality, timeliness of action, personal behavior, clarity of communication, and in countless other respects. Although revenues, profits, production volume and other quantitative goals are good measures for overall corporate performance, they are too broad and crude to serve as effective and motivating measures of individual and group performance on many jobs and activities. But the quality of performance on every job, every activity, and every act can be accurately assessed in terms of values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">American Express is a company dedicated to the value of customer service. The company has discovered how effective values can be for measuring and improving performance. It has set clear standards for what type of service it wants to deliver: replace lost or stolen charge cards within 24 hours, process new card applications within 15 days, ensure bills are completely error free, etc. It has a very sophisticated system for measuring the quality of service by monitoring performance on over 100 different activities. Every month the top management of the company reviews performance on these activities and takes action where necessary to bring it up to standard. The company also has over 100 recognition and reward programs in place to motivate its people to deliver the very best service possible to American Express customers. Cash awards of up to $1000 are given for outstanding individual service.</span><a id="id.mmzqw5vtxf74"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">These and other programs help explain the conclusion of one expert on the credit card industry: &quot;There&#39;s no getting around the fact that American Express&#39;s service is far and away the best in the industry.&quot;</span><span class="c15">14</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values generate profits</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Take a close look at any company with a sustained record of high profits over a considerable period of time. Almost invariably you find that it is one that produces high quality products, delivers excellent service to its customers, insists on cleanliness and orderliness of its facilities, avoids waste of money and materials, functions systematically with good coordination and teamwork, shows respect for its people and provides continuous opportunities for them to grow, and so on. In surveys of over 1,000 American and European companies, we found that companies which rated their implementation of key corporate values the highest also reported the highest levels of revenue growth and profitability in their respective industries.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Robert van Harten, a Dutch researcher, suggests there is a relationship between implementation of high corporate values and the long term share value of public companies. It is common knowledge that share value does not always directly reflect short term financial performance. Non-financial factors such as the perceived quality of management undoubtedly influence investors. The quality of management is a nebulous entity, which has not been adequately defined up until now. The implementation of values is a very direct and appropriate measure of the quality of management.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Studies of performance on specific values indicate a direct link between financial performance and implementation of values. The value quality has become the buzz word and cure all of the eighties, and rightfully so. Quality is powerful stuff. An analysis of 2,600 companies over 15 years by the Strategic Planning Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts revealed that &quot;financial performance is tied directly to the perceived quality of a company&#39;s goods and services. &quot;Companies that offer the highest quality of products and services achieved the best long term financial results in terms of market share, return on investment and asset turnover.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Punctuality or speed is another crucial value for high performance, one whose importance is greater than ever before.</span><a id="id.7xj812v63th7"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Fortune</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">recently ran a feature article entitled &quot;How Managers Can Succeed through Speed.&quot; The article cites a study by McKinsey &amp; Co of manufacturers of hi-tech products, which shows a direct linkage between punctuality and profits. Companies that are able to bring out new products according to schedule earn 33% more profits on them over five years than companies which come to market six months late.</span><span class="c15">15</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values apply to every activity</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As Cavalco found out at Bang &amp; Olufsen, improving corporate performance on a single value can virtually transform the way a company functions. Take punctuality or speed of response for example. Punctuality applies to virtually everything a company does-from the speed with which it answers the phone, replies to letters, processes orders, pays and collects money to the speed with which it adopts new technologies, develops new products, introduces new systems, responds to new market opportunities, recruits and trains people, plans and evaluates work, etc. Actually it is not possible to raise performance on any one value very high without improving performance on other values as well. Punctuality is improved through more systematic functioning, better coordination and teamwork, enhanced communication, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When C &amp; J Industries decided to improve deliver time on their molds, they had to raise performance on a host of other values. First they increased communication and coordination between sales, engineering and production in order to improve production scheduling. Then they analyzed the entire range of molds they were making and found that 85% of them could be built with standard off-the-shelf bases. So they decided to standardized their entire product line and only offer those sizes. They also standardized the process of developing bids for customers&#39; jobs and found they could reduce bidding time by 90%. The company also improved coordination with its supplier of mold bases to ensure that they could always get immediate delivery on the mold bases they required. Defective quality resulted in the need for frequent reworking of molds, which also delayed deliveries. The company made a major commitment to eliminate the need for reworking by improving quality. They introduced a comprehensive quality training program based on Deming&#39;s 14 points to upgrade the skills of their people. Therefore, in trying to improve punctuality, they actually enhanced the values of coordination, standardization, quality and development of people as well. The focus on values enabled C &amp; J to cut their delivery times by 50%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values are the keys to the five engines</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Each component of a business consists of many types of activities. By raising the quality of performance on these activities, we release the potentials of the component and turn it into an engine of growth. Each value can be applied to all of the five components. Quality, accuracy, orderliness, and punctuality are as important in finance as they are in production. Innovation applies to designing systems, developing advertisements and raising capital as much as it does to improving technology. Therefore, raising performance on even one value across the boards can have a tremendous impact on all five components of the company. Every value is a window of opportunity for raising overall corporate functioning, just as much as a new market or a new product.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Waltz Brothers was on the verge of bankruptcy, the owners focused on values to turn their business around. One of the keys to their success was the value systematic functioning. When the four cousins took a close look at their business, they realized that they were spending so much of their time on routine operational tasks that they really had no time left to manage the development of their business. The also saw that many important tasks were not being done very regularly or reliably. They decided that one way to dramatically improve the performance of their company would be to run the company much more systematically. So they reviewed all five components of their business and improved the systems for budgeting and cost control (finance); manpower planning, recruitment and training (people); inventory control and scheduling (organization); quality and maintenance (technology); and sales planning and customer service (market).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Values raise the quality of corporate energies and elevate work</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Values are the most powerful way to release and harness the company&#39;s latent, unutilized energies for growth. The process of energy conversion which we described in Chapter Four takes place in every company. But in most companies, it occurs primarily at the level of physical energy and physical work-which is the lowest and least powerful level of functioning. Values upgrade the quantity and quality of energy available by harnessing organizational energies-the power of authority, freedom, systems, coordination and communication-and psychological energies-our interest, excitement, enthusiasm, pride, emotions, innovation and inspiration. Values elevate our work from the level of mere physical activity to the level of organized efficiency, emotional involvement and mental creativity. Values also focus and multiply these energies more effectively. They refine the lenses and generate more efficient transmission and utilization of the available energies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE was just about the only very fast growing company we visited which has been able to manage rapid growth without a lot of wear and tear on its people. In fact, no matter how hard we tried to get AMRE employees to complain about the pressures of rapid growth, invariably they started talking about how enjoyable it has been to work for the company. Bud Lane joined AMRE as National Production Manager after 25 years with another company in the industry, &quot;because I wanted to work hard and have fun. Its been the most exciting experience of my life. The growth is fascinating, exciting. The first two weeks I was here, at least 100 times I heard people say &#39;I love this company&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE has been able to make a smooth transition from small scale to high growth, which many other companies in the home improvements industry have failed to do in the past. A commitment to powerful corporate values has enabled AMRE to expand rapidly without feeling the stress and burnout so commonly experienced by other fast growing companies.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is a company that believes in standardizing and systematizing everything. The forms and procedures used in every office have been standardized, so that the company can operate a highly decentralized operation and yet maintain uniformity and control. &quot;If we had 44 offices operating 44 different ways, we would go crazy,&quot; says founder Steve Bedowitz. &quot;We are great believers in standardization. We want everything done in the same way in every place. Everything should be kept simple. You can build a large, profitable company by keeping it simple.&quot; The emphasis on organizational values like standardization and systematic functioning has enabled AMRE to operate very smoothly and to grow without stress and strain.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet despite the effort to organize and control, AMRE is a very lively and enjoyable place to work, because the standards and systems are there to make work easier and more pleasant. Hand in hand with these organization values, the company has developed another very powerful value, which continuously releases the psychological energies of its people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE is as much committed to development of its people as it is to its standards and systems. The company implements this value through a wide variety of programs for training sales people and managers, continuing education of employees, and promotion from within. &quot;We promote from within,&quot; says Rob Levin. &quot;That&#39;s important for people to know. People want to know where they can go within the company. Personal growth is very important. It is a great source of pride to walk through the offices and see people who started as accounts payable clerks now in supervising positions. Internal growth is important.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By constantly taking efforts to upgrade the skills and job opportunities of its people, AMRE has established a close linkage between the growth of the company and the growth of its people. Bedowitz explains: &quot;What will keep people excited and happy is to keep the company growing. As long as we continue to grow, the people will see there is room for them to grow.&quot; Not surprisingly, the company has virtually no turnover of administrative employees.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THREE TYPES OF VALUES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The list on the next page includes some of the most important corporate values, but it is not exhaustive. These values are divided into three categories, according to the primary type of energy which the value generates when it is implemented. Implementing values in the first list releases greater physical energy. Work becomes brisk and precise. It proceeds on schedule without interruption. Implementing values in the second list upgrades the functioning of the organization. People, departments and activities function more smoothly and interact more harmoniously. The organization becomes alive and dynamic, responsive and adaptable. There is a sense of competence and momentum. The psychological values release the emotional and mental energies of people in the company, customers, vendors and even the general public. These values make work exciting and rewarding. They generate pride and dedication. They motivate employees to go the extra mile to serve and please the customer. They can also invoke an intensely positive attraction or loyalty from customers-like the intense loyalty of many Macintosh users to Apple Computers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 538.93px; height: 276.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 538.93px; height: 276.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">VALUES PROPEL GROWTH</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our interest in values is far from academic.

In order to evolve the most effective strategies to accelerate the growth of your company, you need to know where it is with respect to values as well. In the next chapter we will examine specific strategies to raise the level of value implementation. But first, think about the values in your company. How many of the values listed above are really important to your company? Which are the strongest? Which are the weakest? Which values have helped propel the growth of your company? Which ones have a direct impact on sales? on profitability? on motivation?

Hard work is the foundation of business. A small, local business, such as a machine shop or retail store managed and operated by the owner, can exist and grow primarily on the basis of physical energy and effort, i.e. hard work. But as soon as a business begins to expand beyond these narrow limits, physical energy and effort are not enough. In order to increase in size, the company finds it has to increase in quality too. It has to provide a product or service that is good enough to attract more customers. It has to be faster in producing goods or serving customers than its local competitors. The company must be able to attract and keep good employees, which means making their jobs more pleasant and satisfying and creating opportunities for their growth. As the company becomes larger and more complex, work has to be better coordinated to avoid confusion and duplication of effort. People must learn to work together smoothly as a team. The growth of a company beyond the minimum size necessitates the development of corporate values like quality, service, punctuality, employee satisfaction, coordination and teamwork. In other words, values propel growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Take any company and add or increase its values and watch it grow. That is what happened to Robert Ross&#39;s company, Ross Incineration Services, thirty years after he founded it, when his children bought the business and added a value to it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The elder Mr. Ross is a physically big and powerful man, with lots of energy, a self-made man like a great many other entrepreneurs, capable of hard work and untiring effort. When he built his first waste incinerator at Grafton, Ohio back in the late 1950s, there was very little public awareness or concern in the country about the dangers or consequences of environmental pollution. So there was relatively little demand for the services he offered. It took nearly thirty years for the company to reach $1 million in revenues. When environmental issues started to emerge as an important national issue in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Ross was happy for the business it generated for his company. But when the Federal Government began strictly regulating the hazard waste industry, Ross felt stifled by the mass of new legislation and resented the burden of cumbersome, bureaucratic procedures, which the new laws imposed. By this time, his son, Gary Ross, and daughter, Maureen Cromling, had become very active in the business. Unlike their father, they were able to accept these changes and could fully appreciate the importance of the new regulations and recognize in them a great opportunity for the company. This prompted them to make two very crucial decisions. First, they bought the company from their father. Second, they made environmental compliance the number one value and priority in the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At a time when many generators and disposers of hazardous waste were using all their ingenuity to find ways around the regulations or to minimize their impact, they decided to implement every new regulation to the fullest extent possible and even go beyond the dictates of the law where public safety would justify it. In doing so, they raised necessity to the level of an ideal.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This effort was extremely laborious and expensive. It involved major investments to upgrade their physical plant. It also involved a complete revision of the systems for handling waste, training employees, tracking shipments, documentation and record-keeping.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At first neither their employees nor their customers could understand the need for these radical changes. Both complained of excessive documentation. But as more and more cases came to light of bad or irresponsible waste management by generators and disposers around the country, Congress pushed through more stringent regulations and the Environmental Protection Agency demanded stricter enforcement by industry. Generators were held responsible for any violations of the law by those who disposed of their waste materials.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ross was well-prepared for these changes. Large chemical companies felt confident that Ross was a safe and reliable company that would comply with all regulations in disposing of their wastes. Ross&#39;s incineration facility was one of the first in the U.S. to be approved under the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s rigorous licensing procedures. Ross is the only facility in the state that is not monitored by a full-time, on-site state official. During the first five years after they purchased the company from their father, revenues rose eight-fold.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By focusing on implementation of a psychological value, Ross was able to elevate the level of its work and the level of service to its customers. It no longer provides merely a physical mechanism for disposal of waste. It also provides legal and psychological security to its customers that their waste is in safe hands. The value raised both the quantity of energy (volume of work) and the quality of energy (from physical to mental) in the company. Adherence to a value enabled Ross to prosper in the new regulatory environment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TRANSITION TO RAPID GROWTH</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The relationship between values and growth can be seen in companies of every size and stage of development. Each time a company makes the transition to the next higher level in terms of the size, scale or complexity of business, it has to significantly increase its implementation of values in order to maintain high performance. Success on a larger scale and at a higher level of the business world is directly and proportionately related to the level and intensity of value implementation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most fast growing companies are companies in the process of transition. They have grown beyond the limits achievable on the basis of purely physical energy and work. They have discovered or at least begun to discover-sometimes almost too late-the importance of corporate values as a means to raise the quality and quantity of energy for continued high performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The personal commitment of the founder or CEO may be enough to ensure high performance on values in the early days of a small business; but as the company grows personal example and enforcement are not enough. That is what Paul Maestri found out after he took his company public in late 1986.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">P.A.M. is a company that shot past the entrepreneurial stage so quickly that it is hard to mark the transition point, growing from $5 million to $75.8 million in eight years. Until then the founders, Paul Maestri and Bob Weaver, had managed the company on their own. They personally dealt with the customers and handled every complaint. They kept in close contact with their drivers and were always available to discuss any problems that might arise. Customers were satisfied. Employee morale was excellent.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">After the company went public, Weaver retired and Maestri decided to hand over management to a group of seasoned executives. He brought in a team of experienced, senior managers from one of his competitors and gave them complete freedom to manage day-to-day operations. Then followed &quot;the most miserable, the most difficult time&quot; of Maestri&#39;s life. The new management team put tremendous pressure on the organization to increase freight volume and expand the fleet. They shifted the focus from quality to quantity, selling price more than service. They distanced themselves from the drivers and took on an &quot;I don&#39;t know you&quot; attitude. Within six months service failure rates rose alarmingly, and customers were vocally complaining. Once satisfied employees were threatening to go on strike, employee turnover increased dramatically. Suddenly profits started to fall (xxx).</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">In growing so rapidly, the company had abandoned some of the basic values which had made it successful in the past. As Maestri put it: &quot;We got away from the customer and the driver.&quot; To save the situation, Maestri replaced the entire senior management team and came back to manage the company full-time. He also hired a new president, John Karlberg, who understood the importance of people and service. Together they took steps to restore and institutionalize the values of people and service and put P.A.M. back on the path of growth. They brought down service failures to below 1%. They gave special training to the telephone dispatchers to teach them how to listen to the drivers and respond to their needs. Regarding service, &quot;Now we are dealing more with the quality concept to develop long term relationships with our customers.&quot; says Karlberg. &quot;The customer is willing to pay a premium price for high value service.&quot; Regarding people, Maestri explains, &quot;We&#39;ve gone back to our original values. The drivers know we care. We give them a fair shake. They all know they can come to me.&quot; Morale improved.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The company began to grow rapidly again.</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Management&#39;s new goal is 30% annual growth until revenues reach $250 million.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The difficulty encountered by P.A.M. in maintaining its values while it grew is quite typical of companies making the transition from an entrepreneurial to a professionally managed company. The way in which they handle this challenge very often determines whether they make that transition at all. P.A.M.&#39;s problems were a direct result of its growth. When the company was smaller, the founders could personally instill and enforce the values they believed in. But like many founders, they had never created an institutional foundation to ensure that the values would continue in their absence. Therefore, Maestri had to return to re-establish the values. Management now realizes that this will not be enough to make the values permanent. &quot;We need to articulate the culture of the company,&quot; Karlberg explained. &quot;We have a ways to go finding our culture and putting it together. We need to articulate our mission, so our employees know that we want to be perfect. &quot;Culture and perfection are a matter of quality, i.e. values. Instilling those values and making them permanent is an essential condition for non-stop growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GROWTH THROUGH VALUES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear Technology is one of the few fast growing companies we studied where the process of institutionalizing values has been taken quite far. Linear has a number of pronounced values which it not only believes in, but also works very hard and systematically to implement. Quality of product, quality of service, reliability and punctuality (on-time delivery) top the list. &quot;Even in starting the new company,&quot; founder-president Robert Swanson explains, &quot;we had the ideas about quality and reliability. We started out a little idealistic-the best product, the best quality, the best reliability and on-time delivery. From the beginning we were and still are doing that. We have generated a quality and reliability image that is a reality.&quot; The company has developed specific quantifiable standards for product quality and service response time, as well as annual goals for raising those standards. It also has created an unusual structure to monitor and enhance performance on these values. There is a single department headed by a vice president responsible for both product quality and customer service and empowered to cross all departmental lines to ensure that these two values are enforced.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At a very early stage the company put in a quality assurance system designed to meet the most stringent requirements of major customers like Ford. The system is so good that Linear became the first company in its product category to get line certification from the U.S. military on the very first inspection. The company&#39;s quality assurance program is a self-sustaining fully documented system more commonly seen in companies ten or one hundred times its size. Linear tests all its products not only to ensure that they meet the product specifications, but to determine whether they will work in a very wide range of different applications for which customers may try to use them. The quality program works so well, because it is understood and supported by every department of the company. &quot;Everyone here has bought into the QA program,&quot; says Paul Chantalat, QA manager.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company really specializes in on-time delivery. The normal lead time for the production of one of their analog chips is 14 weeks. To reduce this time, they have developed a staggered inventory strategy. The company manufactures chips to various stages of completion where they await conversion into a wide variety of finished products. One of the key response times is the time it takes for their sample products to be tested and approved by the customer, which in some cases can be as long as one or two years. By introducing good systems for collecting data and monitoring the test performance of their chips, they have been able to provide key test information to their customers along with the samples. This system has enabled Linear to reduce product qualification time by 50%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most fast growing companies are still in the process of acquiring distinct corporate values and institutionalizing them in every activity. Their success in bringing these values down and making them real in their daily operations will be a critical determinant of how fast and how far they will grow in future.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SUSTAINED SUCCESS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In researching major corporations with a long history of rapid growth and high profitability-companies that consistently rank among the largest, most profitable and most-admired in their industries like American Express, Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, Dupont, General Mills, IBM, Merck, and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance-we found that they were invariably companies with a very strong commitment to a wide range of high corporate values and that this commitment was put into practice in virtually every activity they perform.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Year after year Northwestern Mutual is the best performing and most-admired company in the life insurance industry. The company insists on top quality in just about everything it does. Two closely related values, teamwork and communication, occupy a special place. The company has interdepartmental committees whose primary purpose is to ensure effective communication and teamwork between different parts of the organization. When Northwestern recruits new people, the most important thing they look for is not intelligence, education or experience, but &quot;Can this person work effectively as a member of a team?&quot; Periodically the company conducts confidential surveys asking employees to evaluate the ability of their peers, subordinates, work groups, and even their supervisors to interact well with others and function effectively as members of a team. Based on the survey results, they formulate training needs for</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">every individual</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">and conduct training programs on a wide range of interpersonal and communication skills. Northwestern believes that its commitment to these values not only makes people feel the company is a wonderful place to work. It also goes a long way to explain why Northwestern leads the industry every year on a long list of performance and productivity measures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">INSTITUTIONALIZING VALUES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the ratings you gave to your company&#39;s values in the exercise at the end of the last chapter. Which values can be strengthened to accelerate its growth? Northwestern Mutual is a 100 year old company. But it need not take a century to raise your company&#39;s values to the level Northwestern has attained. It is possible for any company to dramatically increase the implementation of values by following a systematic process. Making values permanent is not an easy task, nor one that can be accomplished by hard work or constant proclamation alone. Values become permanent when they become an integral part and parcel of the way the company carries out all its operations. The process of institutionalizing values requires five essential steps: commitment, standards, structure, systems, and skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Commitment</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Making a firm and genuine decision to implement a value and then remaining committed to that decision through thick and thin is serious business. Its a funny thing, but as soon as companies make that commitment or say they have, life has a way of knocking on the door to test just how serious they really are. That is what Walt Stinson found out at Listen Up when he announced a new customer policy-satisfaction guaranteed or your money back. One customer came in and bought a $15,000 PA system for his car in Aspen, Colorado and brought it back saying he was not satisfied with the quality of the sound it produced-six months later! Walt gave the refund. Another customer, who had bought a $500 car stereo system and a car burglar alarm system, came back to report that the stereo had been stolen and demanded a free replacement, because the alarm system had not prevented the burglary. When asked if the alarm system had failed to operate properly, the customer replied: &quot;No, it operated alright, but it did not stop the robber!&quot; Walt replaced the stolen system.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the values of your company. Is senior management fully committed to those values? Middle management? Other employees? Think about values the company would like to implement better. Is the company really and fully committed to improving performance on them? If you are a divisional, department or branch manager, are you committed to improving value implementation in your area of responsibility?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standards</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Commitment is absolutely essential, but by itself it is not enough. Bob Cavalco learned at Bang &amp; Olufsen that values are too vague and abstract to effectively direct people&#39;s actions. Many companies say they are committed to service, on-time delivery, good communication, employee satisfaction and a host of other high values. But what do they actually mean by these words? Probably each one means something different. Even within a company, these words mean different things to different people. Cleanliness is a key value behind the success of McDonald&#39;s in attracting middle class Americans to its restaurants. When the company tells its employees that cleanliness is a value that must be maintained at all costs, what does that mean? In order to answer that question, McDonald&#39;s has developed detailed written standards of cleanliness for its restaurants, which specify exactly when and how tables, floors, counters, sinks, skillets, closets, windows, utensils, yards, driveways, sidewalks and just about everything else should be cleaned.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When most airlines say their flight departed on time, they mean it took off within fifteen minutes of the scheduled departure time. Delta&#39;s standard is five minutes. American Express&#39;s standard for replacing lost cards is 24 hours, anywhere in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to ensure that everyone understands the same thing when we speak of a value and in order to give a very clear guideline against which to evaluate our performance, values should be defined in terms of simple, quantifiable standards of performance. Virtually any value can be measured against a standard of one type or another.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Merck &amp; Co. has been voted the Most-Admired Corporation in America on the last three annual surveys by</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Fortune</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">magazine. Merck is very strong on values such as product quality, service to customers, technological innovation, systematic functioning, coordination and development of people. But the company is really outstanding on one value, credibility with its customers, which means physicians and pharmacists. Every medical representative, as their sales people are called, is taught the principle of fair balance. In speaking with physicians about the drugs which they produce, Merck insists that their representatives accurately and objectively present both the positive and negative characteristics of each drug. Merck has clear standards for evaluating the credibility of its sales representatives. Periodically it conducts surveys asking physicians to rate the quality and accuracy of the information which the representatives provide them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The top management of Northwestern has measured the clarity and effectivity of its communication with employees by conducting a survey asking employees how much confidence they have in information coming from above. Innovation can be assessed by the number of new ideas, strategies, programs, products or patents generated. The number of complaints received is an index of service quality.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have witnessed groups of senior managers trying to formulate standards for very simple, mundane activities in their companies. It is not long before they discover that creating standards is hard work and quite time-consuming. Managers down the line and on the front lines can play a very constructive role in formulating standards. Those who participate in establishing standards for values are much more motivated to achieve the value in their work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then who should make standards? In our experience, the best results are obtained when senior management sets the broad, overall standards for the company-such as reducing product development time by 50% or completely eliminating safety-related accidents-and then allows operational managers or personnel to formulate the standards for individual tasks or activities that are needed to meet the overall corporate standard.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to be effective, standards should be simple, clear, quantifiable, measurable and achievable. The last adjective is quite important. Standards which everyone knows cannot be achieved will not release energy and motivate people. Even if your ultimate goal is to reach a very high level of perfection, it is better to set an interim goal which everyone can believe in, rather than shooting for the ultimate when it does not appear achievable. Once the interim standard has been reached, it can be revised upward toward your ultimate goal. Standards are most effective when everyone buys into them and feels a challenge to achieve them, not when they are used as a means of pointing out the inadequacies of people&#39;s present performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every value applies to literally hundreds of activities in a company. Standards can be developed for assessing performance on every value for every activity. At least the most important ones should be covered. Are there quantifiable standards for measuring implementation of key values in your company on every important activity?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Structure</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Who is responsible for implementing values in your company? Or rather, is the responsibility of each person for implementing key values clearly defined and understood? Structures define responsibility and authority. They tell us who is in charge of which department, which activity and which value. A structure can be a department, a committee or an individual job description.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear Technology has specific departments for quality assurance and customer service, each headed by a manager, and both presided over by a vice president of quality and service. But the task of implementing quality and service is certainly not left entirely to these three people. These values are far too important and require far too great an effort for a few key people to implement them on their own. Every department at Linear is partially responsible for achieving high quality and service. The product engineers have accepted as their responsibility to design chips that can be manufactured with relative ease and little rejection. The field service engineers are responsible for monitoring performance of the chips in the customers&#39; products and reporting back quality problems that need correction. The production engineers have a responsibility not only for quality but for on-time delivery and quick response to customer enquiries regarding the status of their orders as well. And so on.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At SAS everybody assumes responsibility for getting flights off on-time, even the baggage handlers and maintenance crews. The same is true of every value. In order to really raise value implementation to a high level and keep it there, the responsibility of each person and department for the value should be clearly defined, preferably in writing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Has your company clearly defined the responsibilities of each department and position for implementing key corporate values?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Systems</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Walt Stinson decided to commit Listen Up to the value of customer service, he really did not contemplate what was in store for him. His commitment was genuine. He established clear standards for service in key areas. He took personal responsibility on himself to monitor customer satisfaction and personally reply to every complaint. He assigned responsibilities to his managers and their subordinates for providing good service. But still something more was needed. He found he did not have the systems that were required to make his commitment a reality. For example, the service department set a standard of responding to customer enquiries about the status of a repair job within 30 seconds. That is pretty fast compared with the industry average of several hours and sometimes several days. But the systems Listen Up had in place were not adequate to provide that level of service. A new computerized tracking system had to be developed and introduced that could instantly generate a status report on any pending job. The new system brought down response time to less than one minute, probably a record in the industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are essential both for achieving high performance on values and for monitoring that performance. When Jan Carlzon established the goal of 100% on time departures, a computer terminal was installed on his desk to enable him to monitor corporate performance on the value punctuality. A few years before the recent uproar about late airline departures, we sat in on a typical top management briefing at Delta Airlines, which starts at 9:30am and lasts all of five minutes. Every morning some thirty executives gather in a conference room to listen to reports coming in from stations around the country on the company&#39;s on-time departure rate and other key performance indicators for the previous day&#39;s operations. This simple system enables them to monitor value implementation and take immediate corrective action where necessary.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Merck has elaborate systems to support its commitment to credibility. All advertisements and product literature have to be reviewed and approved by a committee prior to being used. Virtually every piece of paper that goes from the company to the customer is monitored to insure that the information given is correct.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Does your company have in place all the systems it needs to achieve high performance on key values and to monitor that performance on a regular basis? Do all those systems function as smoothly and swiftly as they should? If not, achieving and maintaining your standards may be very difficult. What practical steps can you take to improve your company&#39;s systems for value implementation?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You can have all the good intentions in the world, clear standards, responsible people and magnificent systems, but without the right skills it may all be for naught. At least that is how we felt recently when we visited Dallas to deliver an executive training program and checked into a palatial Dallas hotel for a more than princely price. Before retiring for the night, we ordered coffee for 6:30am. Due to the change in time, we were up an hour early and glad for the extra time to prepare for the meeting. So we called room service to advance our order. Sure enough the coffee arrived five minutes later-good system. At 6:30am there was another knock and another pot of coffee-bad system-which we politely refused. Five minutes later there was a call from room service-quick follow-up, we thought-to enquire why we had refused the second pot. After we explained the circumstances and expressed our understanding of the matter, we were taken aback by the caller&rsquo;s response. &quot;Next time, sir, please do not change your order!&quot; Here was a truly magnificent building, with beautiful rooms and excellent systems to serve, and yet the staff had not been trained not to blame customers for the company&#39;s mistakes. Just one small skill was missing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are literally hundreds of skills needed to achieve high performance on even one value-physical skills, technical skills, organizational skills, interpersonal skills, managerial and psychological skills too. Northwestern Mutual analyzes the training needs of every manager and employee, because the company recognizes the importance of continuously improving the interpersonal skills of its people to support the value of teamwork.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Merck&#39;s sales people have the best reputation among physicians for the quality of service and accuracy of their presentations, because Merck has a training program that has become a model and standard for the pharmaceutical industry. New sales representatives spend ten weeks studying basic medical subjects and must score at least 90% on weekly exams. This is followed by three weeks of training in presentation skills. The next six months are spent accompanying experienced sale people on live sales calls. After nine or ten months, they actually get to go out on a call by themselves. But training is not over. They must still attend regular sessions to further improve their knowledge and skills.</span><a id="id.uiq2ilm612og"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">&quot;Training is our obsession,&quot; says Jerry Keller, a vice president of Merck&#39;s U.S. drug division. &quot;People who come to us from other companies can&#39;t believe we have this kind of program.&quot;</span><span class="c15">16</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If your goal is to achieve high values and non-stop growth, you cannot afford to omit even one small skill. Sounds difficult? It is. That is why high performance and non-stop growth are not a lot more common than they are. It&#39;s difficult, but certainly not impossible or beyond the reach of those who really want it-and there are no short cuts to long term success.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about all the skills your company needs to achieve high performance on key corporate values. Does everyone have the skills they need to fulfill their responsibilities for the value? What additional training should be done to upgrade skills for value implementation?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">GETTING THERE FAST</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process of value implementation outlined in this chapter is comprehensive. Any company can apply it to raise performance on any value to the highest level. But in practice we see that most companies that have achieved high performance on values are companies like American Express, Delta, Merck and Northwestern Mutual, which have been around for quite along time. Does high level value implementation have to take decades?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fortunately, it does not. It is possible to vastly accelerate the normal process of value implementation through a systematic effort. Jan Carlzon and Ben Thompson-McCausland employed this process to suddenly and dramatically raise performance on values in two older companies. Fred Smith followed the same method to raise Federal Express from ground zero to the leader of a whole new industry in a little over a decade.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you really want to see and feel the power of values to generate and release energy, you need only visit the Federal Express hub in Memphis on any weekday night. The place is overflowing with intensity. The company has many high values that contribute to this atmosphere-service, development of people, systematic functioning and others-but unquestionably the one that reigns supreme is being fast and on-time, i.e. punctuality.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Literally everything at Federal Express moves fast-parcels, planes, people, paper, even stairways, one of which had just been moved a few days before our arrival as part of the constant rearranging and redesigning that has continued non-stop for the past 16 years in order to keep up with the fast movement of the company itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Information moves fast at Federal Express too. Fred Smith was not only quick to recognize the latent demand for faster parcel delivery. He realized also that customers are almost as concerned with getting fast and accurate information about their packages as they are about getting the packages themselves very quickly. At FedEx people really believe in the direct relationship between values and profits. Time and quality = money, i.e. the less time and fewer errors, the more profit.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All five stages of value implementation discussed earlier in this chapter are clearly evident at Federal Express.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Commitment</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are visible signs everywhere of Federal Express&#39;s commitment to speed. Every night more than 100 planes fly into Memphis from all over the country between 10pm and 2am to unload some 800,000 packages for transshipment, wait for them to be sorted, and then fly back to where they came from with a fresh load of packages to be delivered. The last scheduled arrival is a DC 10 from Los Angeles carrying 15,000 packages. Should a plane be more than 30 minutes late, it could miss the sort. That means 30,000 unhappy customers-15,000 who sent the parcels and 15,000 who wait to receive them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As part of its commitment to on-time delivery, the company will go to virtually any length to get those 15,000 parcels to their destinations. The company has rented up to 30 Lear jets to fly the packages, which missed the Memphis sort, out on time. Another expression of the company&#39;s commitment: it maintains five extra planes fueled and on runways around the country ready for use in an emergency, though they are called into use less than 1% of the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standards</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Smith&#39;s standard for punctuality is clear and unambiguous-100% on time. &quot;We&#39;re not far off from that now for a transportation company. We&#39;re at an unbelievable level. But I think that through the application of technology we can reach a point where, we probably will never get to 100% in my life time, but we can get to 99.9%.&quot; In 1988 Federal Express achieved an on-time rate of 96%. &quot;Today with one million packages a day, we feel that a 92% service level would put us out of business-that&#39;s a lot of failures&quot; says Ted Weise, senior vice president of Ground Operations. &quot;Even though our service level is now between 96 and 98%, the competition is up to between 88 and 90%. That is how important the 100% goal is.&quot; For 1989 it revised its standard upward to 98%, and you know what happens when the company achieves that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">On-time parcel delivery is only one of the company&#39;s many standards for punctuality. In the customer service department, there is a standard that phones must be answered within 20 seconds. The actual answering time is tracked by computer and is posted on the bulletin board every day. The day we visited the department, the actual average time was 11 seconds.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are strict, very strict, standards for departure and arrival of flights too-within three to five minutes of scheduled time. &quot;Our job in aircraft maintenance is to get every plane off on-time. Our standard is 100%,&quot; says Paul Benbrook, senior manager of Aircraft Maintenance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Structure</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Who is responsible for punctuality at Federal Express? You guessed it-&quot;Everybody is responsible,&quot; says Benbrook. That starts right from the top of the company and goes all the way down. Last fall the company announced to its employees that unless Federal Express achieves the 98% on-time delivery standard in 1989, the management of the company, including the CEO, will not take bonuses. That demonstrates both management&#39;s commitment and responsibility. But accountability does not stop at the top. Benbrook adds, &quot;Every manager is accountable. Even the line mechanics come out to watch the aircraft take off on time.&quot; If a plane is five minutes late it has a major impact on service. Pilot Everett Hicks explains how he and his fellow pilots are responsible for achieving the company&#39;s values. &quot;We have to explain every minute of delay-delays due to fueling, paperwork, crews, maintenance. We run the most on-time airline in the world.&quot; What is true for the pilots is equally true for every station and branch sorting operation. Accountability goes all the way down the line-to the end. If a parcel destined for New Jersey mistakenly lands in Atlanta instead, the error can be traced back to the individual container checker at the hub who was responsible for ensuring it got on the right plane.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Systems</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are a very big part of the reason for Federal Express&#39; phenomenal growth. Working systematically and through systems is itself a core value of this company. Performance against the company&#39;s standards is tracked constantly and broadcast over in-house TV monitors located throughout the company on a continuous basis. A sorter in the hub can read on the screen how many packages were sorted the previous day and how many were delivered on-time. A Service Quality Indicator Report is published weekly. The report monitors a wide range of performance indicators-damaged parcels, missed pick-ups, invoicing errors, everything. &quot;It records the absolute number of failures, not percentages, Roger Podwoski, managing director of Service Systems Administration, explained. &quot;It&#39;s a subtle but important difference. The customer doesn&#39;t care about percentages. He only cares about his package. Our corporate objective is to improve the absolute level of service while growing at 30% per year. Otherwise, no management bonuses this year. That&#39;s our commitment!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These systems involve plenty of hardware and software. They all center around six of IBM&#39;s largest mainframes which constitute the information hub of the company. These computers are linked with an incredible number and variety of computer terminals for customer service, maintenance, sorting, parcel tracking and scheduling. &quot;Information systems hold many companies back,&quot; says Jim Barksdale, the firm&#39;s Chief Operating Officer. &quot;We have been able to grow our systems with the growth of the business. We recognized early that good information is just as much a part of the product as the package.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To understand the magnitude of the company&#39;s achievement, consider that in 1988 the volume of packages it handled increased by 51 million in a single year. That is more than the total volume of packages handled by the company in 1983, i.e. equal to the entire growth of the company during its first decade in business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The heart of the computer operation is COSMOS, which consists of 100,000 computers in offices and vans around the world. Info Week selected this system as one of the top ten strategic information systems in the country. Every pick-up is entered into the system and automatically relayed to a Federal Express courier, who receives direct instructions on DADS, a digitally assisted dispatching system. A terminal unit is housed in every truck. When the courier enters a customer&#39;s premises for a pick-up, he or she enters the parcel into a hand-held supertracker terminal, which is used to scan the airbill number and then slides back into a slot in the truck and immediately transmits the information back to COSMOS. From that moment, through delivery of the parcel to its recipient by another courier, the location of the parcel is tracked continuously by the central system. The DADS unit saves the couriers a lot of time by eliminating the necessity of having them call into dispatchers for instructions. &quot;This system has really energized people,&quot; according to courier Greg Cooper. &quot;Now we have more time to spend with our customers. It has increased the quality of service.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The zip code sorter is a system used in the hub, which provides immediate feedback to parcel sorters regarding their productivity. Even though compensation is not linked in any way with data generated by the system, the feedback has had a significant impact on individual sorting rates.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">COSMOS also provides direct information to the customer. When a customer calls Federal Express for a pick-up, the customer service representative has access to 72 different computer screens of information to answer any questions that may be raised. A caller asking for a parcel to be delivered to a major city may be informed that a parade is scheduled in the destination city the next day, which may prevent delivery of the parcel.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To support punctuality and reliability in the aircraft service division, a computerized maintenance system has been installed. The system informs each airport service station around the country of the repair and maintenance operations to be carried out on each company plane the next day, so that work can be planned well in advance and completed on time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Mcidas, is the acronym for the company&#39;s computerized weather system, which is similar to the one used by NASA for space flights. Federal Express uses the system to reroute its planes to avoid delays due to bad weather. Its 92% accuracy is significantly better than that of the U.S. Weather Bureau.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Skills</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">However impressive the company&#39;s systems may be, no company can achieve 96% or 98% reliability without a tremendous commitment to training. Such high on-time performance depends on people in dozens of departments who must have literally hundreds of different skills for decision-making, planning, forecasting, scheduling, coordinating, communicating, and executing work at all levels of the company. &quot;We have always recognized the significance and importance of training,&quot; says Chief Personnel Officer Jim Perkins.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company has many programs to support the value of punctuality. New couriers undergo a three week program including two weeks of classroom training and one week riding with an experienced courier. Customer service representatives receive a total of four weeks initial training to master the complex computer information system. Their training also includes role playing, enunciation, phraseology, handling irate customers, and stress management. After completing the course, they are monitored regularly and retested twice a year. All senior managers in Customer Service must take the same program and spend a minimum of four hours taking live calls twice a year in order to stay in touch with customers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are many other elements that contribute to the company&#39;s high performance on values like punctuality and service. They are all part and parcel of the Federal Express system. &quot;We have institutionalized the idea of 100% service through communications, awards, discipline, systems, everything,&quot; says Stephen Rutherford, managing director of Human Resources Analysis.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company is constantly being energized by its commitment to high corporate values-or as Ted Weise described it, &quot;by a fanatical urge to do it better.&quot; According to Weise, &quot;To achieve the last 5% in terms of quality of performance requires as much effort as achieving the first 95%.&quot; That commitment and that effort continuously release fresh energies in this company and continuously propel its growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">EVERY VALUE IS AN OPPORTUNITY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.2i3r2uoevz5f"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express institutionalized the process of value implementation during the first decade of its existence. Its ability to achieve such high performance on a range of values has enabled it to keep growing rapidly long after most fast growing companies have levelled off or slowed to a crawl.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Remember, ten years ago Federal Express was only a $160 million company, described as &quot;the fledgling venture that everyone said would never get off the ground.&quot;</span><span class="c15">17</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Six years before that it did not even exist. Five years later it crossed $1 billion. Ten years later it was described by</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Barron&#39;s</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">as &quot;a triumph of free enterprise.&quot; We would prefer to call it &quot;a triumph of values.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process Federal Express followed is essentially the same as that which C &amp; J Industries, Waltz Brothers, SAS and London Life employed to energize themselves for rapid growth. It is a process which any company of any size can employ to double its rate of growth or profitability in a relatively short period of time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What are the values of your company? It sounds like an innocent enough question. Individuals have different values, why shouldn&#39;t companies? But when we refer to corporate values, we are talking about the fundamental elements of successful organizations. The emphasis and relative importance may change, but the values themselves are universals. Review the list of 30 values listed in the previous chapter. Which company can say that it does not believe in or does not want to attain high performance on them all?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every corporate value represents an untapped potential for every company. Each of them is capable of an almost infinite development. How can quality or service, innovation or teamwork be too good, so long as it remains in relative balance with all the other values? There is no company that cannot grow by implementing the values on this list. There is no company that can say it has discovered all the treasures and utilized all the opportunities which even one of these values offer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three Strategies</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then where should we start? Which values should we raise first? Is it more effective to concentrate all your efforts on improving one value or to work on all of them simultaneously?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In our experience there are several effective strategies that can be employed to utilize values as a springboard for rapid growth and doubling profitability. Three different approaches are outlined below. Any company can double its profits in 12 to 24 months using one of these three approaches.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">1. Raise performance on every corporate value by 5 to 10%</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The most powerful way to grow a company is to develop each component and element in a balanced manner. Focusing on the development of many values simultaneously ensures the greatest balance and harmony and generates the maximum results. However, it is also the most difficult strategy to execute, because it requires concentration on many things at once. Incremental progress on many values does not seem as dramatic or significant as sizable progress in one or a few areas, but this strategy generates the maximum results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">2. Implement one value to the highest possible level that it can go</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This approach has the advantage of being very clearly focused on a single goal. Focussing on one value is easier and more dramatic. But raising performance on any value throughout the company requires improving performance on many others as well, so the focus is not as narrow as it may seem. The power of this strategy comes from applying the one chosen value comprehensively in every major and minor activity and raising it to the highest conceivable level in all these areas. If you are working on only one value, it is best to chose one that is centrally related to your business and which is rated weakest of the important values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">3. Implement three values to double their present level</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This strategy is our favorite. It has some of the advantages of both of the others. It is more balanced than focusing on one value and easier to execute than focusing on 30. We recommend selecting three values which are relatively weak and, therefore, possess the greatest potential for improvement. Preferably, one value should be chosen from each of the three categories-physical, organizational and psychological-listed in Chapter Seven When we say double the level of their implementation, we are speaking figuratively. Doubling refers to something mid-way between a 10% increase referred to in the first strategy and the highest possible level referred to in the second. For example, if you have scored the company 60% on a value across the boards, doubling would be raising it to 80%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to facilitate implementation of this strategy, we recommend that the initial effort to improve each of the three values be started three months apart, i.e. start on one value now, another three months later and the third six months later. But once you have started improving a value, it is important to maintain and continue making improvements during successive periods when you are also working on the other values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ACTION PLAN FOR VALUE IMPLEMENTATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">1. Rate your company on all 30 corporate values using the questionnaire at the end of Chapter Seven. Better still, customize the questionnaire to cover all activities which are specifically important for your business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">2. Ask other executives, managers and employees to rate the company (division/office/department) on these values and compare their perceptions with your own.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">3. Conduct discussion groups to examine these differences in perception and arrive at a consensus as to where the company really stands on each value.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">4. Identify specific areas or issues on which implementation of each value should be improved. The issues should cover all five components of the business, all departments, all levels of the company and all activities. If you have chosen strategy 1, then you should identify major issues for each of the 30 values. If you have chosen strategy 2, then you should identify every major and minor issue related to the one value you are working on and pursue each in full detail. For strategy 3, focus on all major and some minor issues related to all three values.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">5. Set clear overall targets for raising the value on each of the issues identified within a specific time-frame.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">6.

First, we looked at the anatomy of a business, the five components-people, technology, market, capital and organization-without which no company can come into existence, survive or grow. Then we looked at corporate physiology, the process by which companies generate and release energy, harness and channel it, and convert it into practical results to achieve their goals for growth and profitability. Finally, we looked at how by focussing on corporate values, companies can raise the process of energy generation and conversion to peak levels for maximum growth and maximum profitability.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We said earlier that the five components are the engines that propel the growth of any business and that each of them contains within itself hidden and untapped powers and potentials which any company can utilize to dramatically accelerate its rate of growth and increase its profitability. Each of the five engines consists of an ascending scale of lesser and greater powers. Some companies tap one or a few of these powers to a considerable extent, but ignore the rest. Other companies release many of them, but to only a very limited degree. The full development of each engine is achieved by harnessing all its powers, just like the full development of a company requires the balanced development of all five components.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many of these powers are quite well-known. Yet we still say they are hidden, because most companies recognize only a small part of their potential and utilize only a tiny fraction of their power. If, as psychologists say a man utilizes only a small part of his intellectual capacity in normal life, it is equally true that companies use a very meager portion of the resources at their disposal. In the next five chapters, we look at some of the hidden powers of the five engines and at practical strategies that can be employed to release them in your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter we will explore the varied powers of the engine people. In virtually every fast growing company we have visited, we heard testaments to the enormous power of people. &quot;People have made this company grow,&quot; says Robert Dobkin of Linear Technology. &quot;People are #1,&quot; says Randy Angelocci of AMRE. Since the goal of this book is to generate rapid growth in your company, we begin with the engine that has propelled most fast growing companies to where they are today. The next chapter explores the powers of the engine organization. If people have been the greatest driving force for growth, organization has unquestionably been the engine which has most commonly stalled and retarded the growth process. Organization is the Achilles&#39; heel of most growth-oriented companies. Strategies to unleash the powers of the other three engines are presented in subsequent chapters.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The powers of people are most dramatically expressed in revolution-the Boston Tea Party, the storming of the Bastille, the flower power of the 1960s. In these rare moments of inspiration (or exasperation), some of the latent powers that lie hidden below respond to an idealistic call and explode upon the placid surface of social life.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Suppose for a moment that a force of this intensity could be released and constructively utilized by an organization for its growth? That company might arise phoenix-like out of nowhere and generate revolutionary shockwaves in its industry-like Apple Computers emerged out of its garage and grew against all odds into a tremendously innovative, competitive and profitable business. Or it might spring out of a dream and create an entirely new industry overnight-as Federal Express created the overnight delivery business. Or it might suddenly rocket from the middle ranks of obscurity to become the undisputed leader of its field and soar on into the future opening one new vista after another, year after year, decade after decade, commanding a pre-eminent position in its field worldwide-the way IBM rose from fifth to first in the punchcard machine industry during the Great Depression, then moved into computers, where it has reigned supreme for four decades. Each of these three companies has grown phenomenally by unleashing the powers of people. Yet, however dramatic and impressive these examples may be, they are partial and inadequate, for even these great corporations have tapped but a little of the hidden potentials of this engine.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">TEN POWERS OF PEOPLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">It was not too long ago that man (or woman) was looked upon by industry as a physical resource to be utilized like any other material resource to the maximum of its physical capacity for work. Labor was regarded as a commodity like oil, a source of physical energy. Over the last century, we have come to realize that men and women possess a productive potential that extends far beyond the limits of the their bodies and</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">physical energies</span><span class="c8">. We have seen in Japan a nation that has generated a formidable productive power by releasing and harnessing the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">social and cultural energies</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">of its people-which are expressed as dedication, patriotism and loyalty to the company and the national economy. The progress of the U.S. over the last 200 years can be traced back to the unique ability of this country to awaken and release the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">creative energies of the individual</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">and to become a nation of entrepreneurs seething with more creative energy and activity than any other in the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Thus we can identify three types or levels of energy in man-the physical energy of his body, the social energy of a common member of the group, and the psychological energy of the unique individual. Every human being possesses these three levels of energy in some measure. Every company taps and utilizes these different energies to some extent. Our aim is to release all of these energies to the maximum extent possible and channel them to achieve maximum results for your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The extent to which these energies are tapped and utilized for work depends on three other important factors: attitudes, skills and values. For each of the three levels of energy-physical, social and psychological-there are attitudes, skills and values which determine how much energy is released and how effectively it is channeled into work. These attitudes, skills and values depend directly on the way we recruit, train, motivate and direct the activities of our people. Together they combine to generate a multitude of powerful levers for energizing your company through people. This chapter examines ten graded powers of people. Let us begin with the known and the obvious and explore the ascending powers of people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Physical Energy</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What is the first thing you look for when you recruit new people? In the old days when railway contractors were hiring labor to lay tracks across the country, the bosses naturally looked for the biggest and strongest men available to cut the timber and lay the gauge. Few jobs these days demand that type of physical size or strength, but the physical health and energy of a person is just as important as it ever was. Yet it is surprising how few companies consciously look for energy when they recruit new people. Try thinking creatively, being enthusiastic and inspiring other people when you have a 102 degree fever, and you will understand the importance of physical energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That energy is the foundation for all physical work. The more abundant it is, the more lively and resilient the work. When that energy is lacking, work becomes a drag and a strain. It slows to a crawl and leads to frustration, errors and waste. Add a little burst of fresh energy and work that was grinding picks up and is easily accomplished. Recruiting people with high levels of energy and good health makes everything a company does that much easier and more successful. How are you going to have a high energy company without high energy people?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The first thing that struck Neal Amarino when he joined Vipont Pharmaceuticals was &quot;the energy of the people. There is a different feeling...an excitement...an air of expectation about what is to come.&quot; Many of the fast growing companies we have seen go out of their way to look for people with the energy needed for quick action and non-stop change. AMRE looks for high energy sales people. Linear Technology wants chip designers who are not only technically qualified, but who have the energy and persistence to push their designs all the way through and make sure that they get translated into products. &quot;In order to make these products successful, you just have to pour your energy into them,&quot; says designer Tom Redfern. &quot;We look for people whose designs are translated into production, not just those that like the work they do,&quot; says Carl Nelson. &quot;Did he get his products out into production. Does he have the energy and drive to make things work.&quot; Gartner Group even selects computer industry researchers for their energy level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">According to Jim Perkins, Chief Personnel Officer, from the beginning Federal Express &quot;attracted people with a very high energy level.&quot; High energy starts at the top with the management team, says Fred Smith.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;You have to put high energy people in the key positions. You&#39;ve got to have an enormous amount of energy...The watchword at FedEx is action. God knows you can get a lot people who can identify problems. The trick is to find that one jewel who can solve one. That&#39;s why you need that high energy level, a penchant for action.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Compensation</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Getting energetic people is the first essential step. Getting them to express that energy in work is the second, and that has a lot to do with compensation. There is a great deal of truth in the old adage, &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot; We have seen companies invent many clever ways to get more from their people than they give, but very few prove more resourceful than their people in maintaining a fair balance between work and rewards.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express wants every employee in every department to go that extra mile to cut an extra minute off delivery times. The company pays well across the boards for that effort. &quot;Our people concept is simple,&quot; Perkins says. &quot;If you take care of the people, they will deliver the service efficiently with a smile. We believe that the profits will somehow come as a result of that.&quot; Couriers in major markets earn between $30,000 and $40,000. &quot;We review our pay structures constantly,&quot; says vice president of hub operations, Karl Birkholz. &quot;You can lose key people by insensitivity. We share the profits with all employees. We even treat part time employees the same as full-timers in terms of the benefits they receive-medical, profit sharing bonuses, etc. This policy has really reduced absenteeism and turnover.&quot; In a company that has employees about 18,000 part-time people, that policy represents a sizable commitment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order for compensation to release people&#39;s physical energies for work, it must be perceived as fair. We have been in companies with high absenteeism, high turnover and low morale that never seem to make the connection between pay and performance. Even when companies realize they are losing people because they pay poorly, many think &quot;Why should I pay more when I can always get new people to take their place?&quot; The real cost in terms of money and management time spent in recruiting and training new people almost always exceeds the savings from keeping salaries low. But the real cost is in morale and the energy output of those who accept low pay.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Compensation should be perceived as fair, which means it is not enough that it is fair. Some companies offer low pay and excellent benefits which more than make up for the low base. But offering good benefits along with low base pay usually does not work. Employees tend to look on base salary as the measure of their worth and bonuses and profit-sharing as something extra, based on their performance and the company&#39;s. Other companies offer excellent benefits but forget to &quot;sell&quot; them to employees, who often do not fully realize the value of what is offered unless it is fully explained. Rich Pagliari of Elizabeth Carbide in Pennsylvania explained how he was losing skilled workers to his competitors who offered higher base salaries, only to have many of them come back to reapply for their old jobs after they realized that the benefits Elizabeth offered were far superior. Now Pagliari educates all his employees about exactly what the benefits package contains and what it is worth to them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pay &amp; Performance</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Beyond fairness, there are higher dimensions to compensation, which can release many times greater energy than equal pay for equal work. These dimensions are linked with people&#39;s social aspirations to rise in life and their psychological aspirations for personal growth, of which income is taken as an outward expression. Though these dimensions are more rightly categorized higher in the progression of powers, they are discussed here for the sake of completeness.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Compensation releases a lot more energy when it is directly tied to performance. Many successful companies have gone through periods when their top sales people earned more than their top executives. Aggressive 30 year old sales people at Gartner Group take home an average of $100,000 to $150,000 a year. Gartner&#39;s sales people receive a fixed salary which represents roughly 35% of their pay. The balance two-thirds is based on sales performance. The company says their sales people outsell competitors two to one.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But even more interesting is the pay package for the information researchers creating useful ideas in the bowels of Gartner&#39;s research division. &quot;We pay more for analysts and get high quality people,&quot; says senior vice-president of Sales, Rick Smith. Analysts&#39; pay is based on 65% fixed salary and 35% performance-related bonus, which is directly linked to the financial success of the information services which each analyst works on. Gartner&#39;s rationale is that a researcher paid on the success of the information services he or she produces will be much more attuned and sensitive to customers&#39; needs.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">High pay is not confined to hi-tech industries. AMRE is only too happy when a commissioned sales person reaps an executive-size pay check. &quot;The first thing we do to energize our people is make sure they have a chance to make a lot of money,&quot; says Bedowitz. The top AMRE sales person last year earned $140,000, and the average was around $55,000 to $65,000. &quot;A sales person should make a minimum of $40,000 a year or he or she probably shouldn&#39;t be here.&quot; Randy Angelocci, vice president of sales, says, &quot;Our sales people are on straight commission. They have no limits. That brings out the best in everybody. The sales people love the challenge of being able to make whatever they can.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Share The Wealth</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The greatest power of compensation is released when the growth of the individual and the growth of the company are very closely linked with one another. If there is one belief that fast growing companies hold in common, it is the dictum, &quot;Share the wealth.&quot; This principle has had a lot to do with Expeditors International&#39;s explosive growth over the past five years. Every branch manager has invested personally in the local branch company he or she manages and receives, in addition to salary, 22% of the pre-tax operating income of the office, to take home and/or distribute to employees as an incentive. One implication of this arrangement is that if the branch office fails to collect payment from a customer, 22% of the loss comes out of the manager&#39;s incentive pay. Dave Lincoln, controller, stressed the importance of this system. &quot;We haven&#39;t lost any key people that we wanted to keep. The reason is the branch compensation program. If you are successful, you are rewarded. We reward those who have produced.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A point often comes in the growth of a privately-owned company, when the founders are tempted to take their company public in order to raise additional capital or simply to capitalize their own assets in the company. A less common motive, but one which can have considerable impact on the future performance of the company, is the ability of public corporations to offer stock options to employees that may appreciate rapidly as the company grows.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many private corporations that do not need the capital may still benefit immensely from opening up ownership to a larger number of employees. When Vipont Pharmaceuticals started to grow rapidly in the early 1980s, the company was not in a position to offer lucrative salaries to attract top talents. So it coupled a modest pay package with an aggressive stock-option plan that has made many employees shareholders and some of them quite wealthy. Today 30% of the shares are owned by Vipont employees. Michelle Morgan, Director of Marketing, at Vipont Pharmaceuticals summed up a feeling frequently expressed by people in these companies: &quot;Sharing in the profits, we not only make money for shareholders. We also make money for ourselves. This has had a big role. It gives people a common goal and purpose.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;It is no secret,&quot; says Linear Technology&#39;s Robert Swanson. &quot;Successful companies are companies that share the wealth. We drive our people here. This is a big time business with big money to be made. Financial rewards are a big part of what this company is about.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Until two years every Linear employee owned stock in the company. Every employee was given 100 shares of stock at the end of their first and second year with the company. &quot;We wanted everybody to have a piece of the action.&quot; Last year the company funded a profit-sharing program based on salary in which everyone participates as well. It also gave bonuses to both hourly and salaried employees. Linear&#39;s vice-president of Operations, Brian Hollins, says, &quot;Profit-sharing has been a very important incentive. We give stock options which make people feel like they have a piece of the rock.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Gartner Group was founded, one third of the equity was set aside for distribution to employees other than the founders. &quot;Typically the entrepreneur is sole proprietor and over time he might provide some equity shares to key people,&quot; Gartner explained. &quot;But we allocated a third of the equity from day one to a broad spectrum of partners beyond myself. That&#39;s a big chunk of equity that was reserved for people who had nothing to do with founding the company.&quot; At the time of our study, virtually every analyst in the company was a shareholder.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the structure of compensation in your company. How effectively does it release the physical energies of your people for hard work? Does it sufficiently motivate them to perform at peak levels of enthusiasm? Does it create a direct and proportionate link between the financial success of the company and the financial rewards for your people?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Exceptions to the Rule</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How simple the world would be if everything were that simple. But there is a corollary to every good principle, and a good corollary often contradicts the principle it is intended to modify. Such is the case with &quot;share the wealth.&quot; Good compensation is not only or always energizing. There are at least two fairly common situations in which it can also be de-energizing. The first is a well-known phenomenon in fast growing public companies which have done exactly what we have described so far in this chapter. It is the phenomenon of satisfaction. Some people who join a company before or during the early stages of its take-off reap such enormous financial rewards from being in the right time at the right place that they become satisfied and level off.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most of the fast growing companies we have been into have either had that experience or are now in the midst of it. They find they have promoted people to high level positions at an early stage who either do not have the skills to support the further growth of the company or do not have the drive to make it happen, because they are satisfied. One CEO was frank enough to raise the question as to whether he or any of the original founders were really competent to take the company to the next plateau. Another expressed his frustration at not being able to motivate his second level executives to take up part of the burden of energizing the company for further growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet in most cases we found that the loss of motivation was not entirely or even primarily due to the enormous rewards. There are many senior executives of fast growing companies who have become millionaires in their early thirties, yet still enjoy their work immensely and feel highly motivated to grow the company further. Very often the problem is not too much money, but too much stress from an under-organized organization or too much pressure and too little freedom from an over-bearing CEO. Sometimes it is simply because the demands of growth have left no time for the executive to acquire the skills needed to keep up with it. Any of these situations can be remedied, if the people involved recognize their source and are willing for the effort.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The second exception to the principle of paying more is not so easily resolved. The corollary states: if a person is paid more than his capacities or his sense of responsibility justify, he may not only level-off but even become a disturbing and troublesome influence in the company. We have seen this phenomenon time and again at every level from senior executives to clerks and laborers. Yet surprisingly few managers recognize the danger. When a person is paid more than their abilities or commitment justify, some individuals work that much harder in order to compensate and justify the higher pay. But others consciously or unconsciously justify it, not by working harder, but by finding real or imaginary grievances against the company and its management. They complain and foment discontent among their colleagues. We once asked a personnel consultant to think back over all the cases he could remember of problem employees and ask himself whether they were individuals who were paid more or less than they probably deserved. To his own surprise, he replied that virtually all were paid too much.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Training Energizes</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think of the last time you attempted a task for which you lacked the necessary skill-cooking a meal if you are not a cook, calculating your family&#39;s tax returns, struggling through a computer program you have never used before, typing a letter when your secretary was out sick or trying to figure out how the new phone system works! You are asked to interview a job candidate and feel awkward or uncomfortable, because you have never been trained in how to conduct an interview. You are asked to make a presentation before a large group for the first time. You are asked to develop a strategic plan and are ashamed to tell your board or your boss that you do not know how. Life can suddenly become frustrating, annoying, grating on the nerves, even terrifying.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Now think of the last time you were taught or taught yourself a new skill. You took a day off to read the software manual and really understand how that program works. In half a day you are up and running and humming along like a pro. You read the instructions for the phone system and discovered to your surprise that the world is rational after all. The system does more than you ever dreamed of. You took a course in interviewing or presentation skills and learned enough small tricks the first day to feel relaxed and fairly proficient.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Learning a new skill is energizing</span><span class="c3">. It can even be exhilarating. Exercising a skill in which you are competent generates a sense of confidence and mastery. It makes any work enjoyable, even exciting.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now think of all the people in your company who have never been trained to do all the things they are doing. How much agony could have been avoided? How much energy could have been released by creating a structured situation where learning generates a sense of accomplishment and mastery, instead of frustration and failure? Think of all the people even now who are doing tasks for which they do not possess all the knowledge and skills needed to do it perfectly and feel good about their work, even if they will not admit it out of pride or insecurity. A tremendous amount of energy can be released in these people by giving them training to make the exercise of their skills perfect and enjoyable.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dave Gray is a middle aged middle manager at Nedlloyd Lines&#39; London office. When Rick de Rooy was transferred from San Francisco to become CEO of Nedlloyd&#39;s U.K. operations, his predecessor described Gray as a troublesome, pessimistic, complaining type who was a thorn in everyone&#39;s side, a poor worker and a bad manager. Six months later de Rooy meet his predecessor at a corporate gathering and their conversation came to Gray. The previous CEO was surprised to hear that Gray was still with the company. But he was down-right shocked to hear that de Rooy considered him one of the company&#39;s best motivated and most productive employees. De Rooy went on to explain that over the last six months, he had reassigned Gray from his administrative position to assume responsibility for installation and operation of the company&#39;s new worldwide computerized information system, a job for which Gray had absolutely no prior training or experience. When we met Gray a few months later, we found an exuberant and enthusiastic individual behaving like he had just had a wonderful time on his first date with a beautiful girl. He had just completed a training course on the new computer system and could not say enough about how much he loved the company and his new job. Learning a new skill has that much power.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dave Gray&#39;s experience is one instance of a truth which IBM has known for decades. Last year while we were at Marriott&#39;s 1,500 room resort hotel in San Diego for a conference, half of the hotel was filled with IBM production workers and managers being retrained for positions in marketing. A total of 10,000 IBM employees went through the program. IBM spends more on corporate training for its people than the entire budget of Harvard University-$750 million or 1.5% of sales last year-and probably generates more professional managers than all the business schools put together. Ex-IBM people occupy high positions in both mature and fast growing companies in virtually every industry, because they train their people so well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Embassy Suites Hotels is rated extremely high by consumers for quality of service and the efficiency and courtesy of their staff. A guiding principle of the company is that minimum wage employees possess the ability to perform well in higher level positions, provided they are given proper training. &quot;Historically hotel managers have believed that minimum-wage workers aren&#39;t smart or ambitious,&quot; says President Harvey Feldman. &quot;With training and experience, they all have the curiosity and intelligence to go beyond making beds.&quot;</span><span class="c15">18</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Embassy Suites has a pay system that is based on skills to encourage continuous training. The company offers a variety of skill courses and awards pay increases to those who pass them. Thus, the company mobilizes two powerful levers-compensation and training-for releasing greater energy from their people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Training not only energizes people. It makes good financial sense too.</span><a id="id.xwnb441dfx6k"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">A few years ago Motorola substantially increased their investment in training production workers on quality and problem-solving. Overall the expenditure on training rose to $90 million, equal to about 2.6% of payroll or close to 1% of sales. The results have been dramatic, says the company&#39;s training head, Bill Wiggenhorn. &quot;We&#39;ve documented the savings from the statistical process control methods and problem solving methods we&#39;ve trained our people in.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">We&#39;re running a rate of return of about 30 times the dollars invested.&quot;</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15">19</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Three Levels of Skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As there are graded levels or methods of compensation, there is an ascending gradation of skills that can release and direct the expression of people&#39;s energies. The first level consists of physical skills (e.g. driving or typing) and technical skills (e.g. product knowledge, repairing a product, operating equipment) which release and direct people&#39;s physical energies. Interpersonal skills (e.g. selling, negotiating, communicating, motivating) and organizational skills (e.g. systematizing, coordinating) are of a higher level and are more powerful energizers. The highest level skills are mental (e.g. managing, planning, problem-solving) and psychological (e.g. understanding and judging people, giving attention, pleasing others). Although the interpersonal, organizational and higher order skills possess a greater capacity to release and harness energy, for purposes of completeness we refer to them all at this point in the progression of powers for energizing people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Which skills should we train for? Train for every physical, technical, interpersonal, organizational, managerial and psychological skill required to be the very best in your business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How much or how often should we train our people? As much and as often as possible, and keep on training them. There is no more powerful way to energize your people and your company for non-stop growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Run down a quick checklist in your mind. Just list all the problems-big ones and small ones-which you encounter in day-to-day business with your employees, your managers, your customers and vendors. Nothing is too small for the list. If you scrutinize that list, a vast majority of those problems can be traced back to someone who is not properly educated or trained. Take basic things like documentation, for instance. Listen Up was being constantly harassed by its inability to maintain accurate inventory records. No matter how often they re-counted the inventory and set it right, it quickly got out of balance again. On investigation the company traced a major part of the problem to the fact that nearly 25% of the sales receipts filled out by its sales people contained errors, so the inventory system was continuously being fed with erroneous information. What the company needed was not a new inventory system, but better training on basic documentation skills for its technically qualified sales staff. Physical skills are that critical to every business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think of the best sales person in your company. Think of other sales people who perform at an average or below average level. What would be the impact on the profitability of your company, if every average sales person could be raised to 80 or 90% of the level achieved by the best and if every poor performer could be lifted to the level of today&#39;s average? Wayne Puntel of Audio Craft runs one of the most profitable retail chains in his industry. He completed the exercise described at the end of this chapter and was shocked by the answer he came up with-a potential 100% increase in profitability. Actually, during the next six months Puntel&#39;s profits soared 40%. What about for your company?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now suppose you completed the same analysis for your production workers, design people, marketing, finance, and managerial staff. What would be the impact on their energy and morale? What would be the impact on corporate revenues and profits? Double like Audio Craft? Or 30 fold return on investment like Motorola? Or more?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">No Time for Training</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As we went from one fast growing company to another, we were somewhat surprised at how uncommon formal training programs are and how seriously they have retarded the growth of these businesses. Time and again we heard people say, &quot;There is no formal training,&quot; and in the next breath remark, &quot;My biggest fear looking at our growth is how are we going to continue to get the types of people and the numbers we need.&quot; In our surveys of American and European companies, a shortage of skilled people and no time for training were among the most frequently cited characteristics of rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Companies which continue to grow over long periods of time put in place the training systems needed to generate highly skilled people from within, rather then remain dependent on the whims and fluctuations of the marketplace. Otherwise, sooner or later they discover that the pace of growth outstrips the availability of qualified and experienced people. Federal Express had such systems in place from day one. &quot;The easiest thing that management can do is put training on the back burner,&quot; says Birkholz. &quot;But training should be right up front ahead of everything else. I am only as efficient as my people make me.&quot; Every new employee goes through an extensive training program. In order to provide a high quality of training effectively and efficiently, the company utilizes interactive video. This enables employees to learn at their own pace and guide themselves through learning sessions simply by touching the screen. The same method is used for constantly updating the skills of more experienced people. Flight crew members are required to complete a training course every time they change positions on a plane. Normally the course requires about 21 days of training time. By putting the course on interactive video, that time is expected to be reduced to 16 days. If Federal Express has found ways to train its people while in the process of growing from zero to more than $4 billion in 16 years, other fast growing companies can too, and need to if they really want to keep growing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One common attitude regarding training is summed up in the words, &quot;We cannot train the people we need. Our business is unique. The only way for people to learn our business is to spend two or three years on the job and learn it from the bottom up.&quot; In a country where we train physicists to smash atoms and physicians to give us new livers and hearts, it is surprising how many companies believe that their business is unique. Yet the most successful companies in every industry are companies that believe that they can teach virtually anyone their business, given the time, interest and minimum capacity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you have been thinking that your&#39;s is a business that defies formal training, think about this. The fundamental principle of education is that it is possible to teach the next generation in a few years the essence of what the entire society or world has learned about a subject over many centuries. The fundamental principle of formal training is that it is possible to teach any capable person in a relatively short period of time the knowledge and skills for a job which others have acquired through long years of work experienced-if not completely and 100%, then at least to the point where they will be functionally competent with a minimum of on-the-job experience. Formal training is not only much faster. It is also more complete and comprehensive in scope than learning from experience. When you learn from experience, you only learn about those things which are presented to you, not about all the other problems or solutions that are possible; and you only learn from those who are physically near you, not from all those who have acquired knowledge on the subject who you do not know or cannot meet.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Even on-the-job or apprenticeship training can be much more or less energizing, depending upon how it is done. Many companies look upon a long apprenticeship training as an indispensable tradition, when often it has degenerated into a dead habit. Kennedy and Bowden Machine Co. found that this is exactly what had happened to their apprenticeship training program for toolmakers. &quot;The apprentices were demotivated. They were never given tasks beyond their capacity, which means beyond what they had already done before. They were getting all the grunt jobs that nobody else wanted to do,&quot; Ray Kennedy explained. Under heavy pressure to speed up deliveries, Kennedy assigned each apprentice to an experienced toolmaker and asked the toolmaker to provide the apprentice with challenging tasks that were within their level of competence to perform. Kennedy said, &quot;I walked around the shop and was really surprised at the work the apprentices were able to do under supervision. I myself probably would not have had the confidence to assign those tasks to such inexperienced people. But the toolmakers knew what they could do better.&quot; The attitude of the apprentices changed dramatically overnight. They felt stimulated and challenged. Employee turnover stopped. The result was a vast increase in the productivity of the shop, a steep fall in overtime costs and better on-time delivery to customers. Kennedy released some of the latent capacity that was in his people all the time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Buzz Zsitas is chief financial officer at C &amp; J Industries. Recently Buzz stood up in front of a few hundred members of his industry and told them: &quot;You have probably never heard this from a financial person before. But my advice to all of you is to go back to your companies and spend a lot more money on training your people. The returns are really phenomenal.&quot; Buzz speaks with conviction, because he speaks from experience. When Harold Corner was engineering C &amp; J&#39;s turnaround, he hired a director of human resources and carried out an in depth analysis of the skills required for every job in the company. The director then compared the job requirements with actual skill levels of employees and developed a training needs analysis for each individual. He found that most of the skills needed could be acquired through courses at the local community college at very low cost. This aggressive training program has enabled C &amp; J to grow from 185 to 325 people over the last two years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Physical Values</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In Chapter Seven, we classified corporate values under three different categories according to the dominant type of energy which they release when implemented. Among the physical values are listed cleanliness, orderliness, punctuality, regularity, safety, quality and several others. When an individual or a company focuses intently on the implementation of any of these values, a tremendous amount of physical energy is released.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cleanliness</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is something about cleanliness which defies explanation. With rare exception, companies which sustain high rates of growth and high levels of profit seem to have an obsession with cleanliness. It is not a matter of industry or even country for that matter. We have observed the same phenomenon in India and Indiana, in computer manufacturing and shoe making. Anheuser Busch, Coca-Cola, Disney, DuPont, IBM, Intel, Marriott, McDonald&#39;s and Merck are just a few of the companies that have lost all sense of proportion when it comes to cleanliness.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Paul Maestri insisted on cleanliness even back when the company was operating out a trailer and doing repairs under an oak tree. Today you could almost eat off the floors in P.A.M.&#39;s repair shops. The company&#39;s 700 trucks and 1,500 trailers are maintained the same way. Everything is immaculate. The same is true of the offices. Everyone is expected to leave their desk clean every night. How do people respond to cleanliness? Nancy Johncox, one of P.A.M.&#39;s four original employees says, &quot;It gives people a sense of pride. It makes the drivers feel like professionals.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;Cleanliness has been a value at Federal Express since the very beginning,&quot; says Carole Presley, senior vice president of Marketing and Corporate Communications. &quot;It generates a feeling of security and confidence. You have to work hard at it every day.&quot; That effort releases energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But even more striking and more inexplicable is what we have observed in companies which make an effort to dramatically improve the level of cleanliness in their facilities. People get energized and money pours in. That is what happened to Listen Up when Walt Stinson ordered a wholesale cleaning of all the company&#39;s showrooms, offices and warehouses a few years ago. &quot;The whole company got charged up, energized. And quite unexpectedly we received a lot of money from different sources which we really needed at the time but had not counted on receiving.&quot; Sounds ridiculous? Why not try cleaning and see.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Examine any work area where quality is poor, accidents frequently occur or morale is a problem. Chances are it is also dirty. When Iacocca took over at Chrysler, the company&#39;s plants were seething with every variety of trouble-labor unrest, gambling, prostitution, even a murder. And they were filthy too!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A few years ago we met a consultant who specializes in turning around near bankrupt companies and making them solvent again. What is the very first thing he does when he goes into a new company? He has the entire place painted and made spotlessly clean. Imagine spending precious dollars on painting the walls when creditors are knocking at or down the doors. But it works for him.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Orderliness</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Orderliness is another physical value with a great power to energize work and people. Remove a little orderliness and watch what happens. Work gets bogged down and loses momentum. You spend time searching for a file or an object and end up exasperated or exhausted. Add a little orderliness to a chaotic situation and it feels like a breath of fresh air. People relax, cheer up and work flows more smoothly. Orderliness has a greater power than cleanliness, because it requires mental as well as physical effort to put things in a rational order. How many companies have we been in where a sales person cannot find a product brochure for the customer or the service technician cannot locate a repair manual he needs to fix a machine.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">An inspector from the U.S. Department of Transportation, who asked the service manager for the maintenance file on one of P.A.M.&#39;s 700 trucks, was virtually speechless with amazement when it was produced in less than thirty seconds from a well-ordered filing system. That is how unusual orderliness is in the companies he visits. &quot;Cleanliness and orderliness help to coordinate work. They are good for morale. They also give a good impression to the customer,&quot; says P.A.M.&#39;s manager of vehicle maintenance, Roy Strode. From the office of the chairman and CEO down to the level of the repair shop, from the files to the secretary&#39;s drawers and the executive&#39;s briefcase, orderliness is hard to come by. Install it where it is absent and energy flows.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Safety</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Safety is another powerful value that can release abundant physical energy, but which also has the capacity to release higher energies as well. Safety requires a clean and orderly environment, as well as well-timed and disciplined actions. It takes a lot more effort to maintain an accident-free environment than it does to maintain a clean and orderly one, but the resulting release of energy is even greater. One of the strategies that Waltz Brothers employed to energize their company for a quick turn-around was to focus on improving safety in the plant. They established a safety committee, on which every employee in the company was asked to serve for three month periods. The committee got everyone actively involved, brought down the accident rate to almost zero and resulted in lower insurance charges.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Some companies, like P.A.M., have made safety into a real motivator. P.A.M. presents safety awards to drivers who maintain accident-free records. Those that go a year without any accident join an exclusive club called &quot;Randy&#39;s Rangers&quot; and get diamond rings. Each additional accident-free year, another diamond is added to it. When new trucks are purchased with more comfortable driver compartments and other improvements, the rangers are first to get them. The most energizing thing about safety is that it says to employees &quot;we care.&quot; That releases not only physical energy, but psychological energy as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How much energy does your company release in its people by implementing values like cleanliness, orderliness and safety or other physical values? Why not increase the level of commitment and implementation to raise corporate energies to their peak?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Social Recognition</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Physical energy, material compensation, training on physical skills and implementation of physical values form the foundation. By themselves they can be great sources of energy. Yet by comparison with what lies beyond, they are limited, the least powerful of the hidden potentials of people. But if this foundation is not properly laid, it is difficult for the higher powers to emerge and express in work. Physical energy and skill ensure that the people have the basic capacities needed for work. Fair compensation provides the motive for expressing those capacities in work. Physical values raise pride and precision in work to a far higher level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But the individual is more than just an animated and intelligent machine functioning independently of others. Each person has a social personality that responds to attention and recognition from others, that cares-whether we admit it or not-what others feel and think about us, that wants to be accepted and appreciated, that is motivated to equal or excel with reference to our peers, that aspires to be more than it was today. Companies that recognize the social needs of their people and create opportunities for the fulfillment of those needs release powerful energies in their people, energies which material incentives alone cannot bring out.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The simplest way to tap these energies is to create an external standard by which people can evaluate their own performance. Regardless of the level of compensation, people like to feel that they possess the competence to a do a good job. Yet surprisingly often they have no clear indication of how they are performing at all, because no one has ever told them or created a measure by which they could assess themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Jerry Kowitz, the owner of Jerry&#39;s Audio chain in Phoenix, was quite unsatisfied by the performance of one of his salesmen and took great efforts to try to improve it through training programs and frequent personal discussions. In spite of these efforts, the salesman continued to perform far below the level of his peers. After some time Jerry started posting a list on the bathroom wall every week of the sales made by each sales person. To his great surprise, in a few weeks the poor performer started improving. He rose from the bottom to the middle ranks and then to within the top 25% of the sales force. Perplexed by this sudden change, Jerry called him in and asked for an explanation of his remarkable improvement. The salesman replied: &quot;I was really quite satisfied with my earlier level of performance. I was making enough money to be comfortable. But when you started posting that list, I just could not stand to see my name at the bottom week after week.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Some time ago, Walt Stinson introduced a sales person of the month award at Listen Up. The award consisted of a bonus and a letter from Walt to the salesman&#39;s family informing them of what a great job the salesman was doing. For the first nine months the same salesman won the award every month. Then Walt decided that writing home every month to the same family had become a little redundant, so he stopped sending the letters. The salesman later complained how disappointed he was when the letters stopped going home. &quot;You just don&#39;t know how much it meant to me and my family to get that letter every month. It made them proud and me happy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If a list on the wall or a letter home can have that much impact, how much more powerful can be awards and celebration programs that generate widespread social recognition for high achievement. As AMRE grew bigger, management found it more and more difficult to keep in touch with people through informal means. So the company has established a host of social programs to recognize and reward high performance, including a President&#39;s Club, plaques and diamond rings for top sales people, awards and prizes for production and administrative personnel. They also go to considerable expense to bring together many employees and their spouses-some 1,300 people last year-from offices around the country once a year for a lavish annual Christmas party.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The recognition and celebrations at AMRE are not just hype. They reflect a basic philosophy and understanding. Bedowitz explains:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;Ideas and organization are worthless without the people to carry them out. People got us to where we are today. People are going to take us to where we will be tomorrow. Our value is to take care of the people...One of the keys to our long term success is that we have fun and we encourage our people to have fun. We look at the better performing offices and see that they are the ones that are having more fun. If the receptionist isn&#39;t smiling, we know there is a problem in the office. We try to make sure that everyone has fun. We like to think we are a family.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Entrepreneurs are often the independent type. Some have difficulty appreciating just how important social recognition can be to their employees, little realizing how much they appreciate the nod of recognition from the Board of Directors, the smile of appreciation from their own family members or even a complimentary word from their own subordinates! The power and appeal of that recognition are so great, that every year a good number of highly successful businessmen are lured by it to accept honorary posts as presidents of industrial associations, so that they can tour the country and lobby in Washington without pay on behalf of their own competitors, while their own businesses suffer from neglect back home! That is the power of social recognition.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Career Paths</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We referred in Chapter One to the close relationship between the growth of a company and the opportunities which it creates for the growth of its people. Companies take conscious efforts to help their people grow the fastest, the farthest and the longest. Linking personal compensation to corporate profits is one way in which this is accomplished. Creating opportunities for continuous promotion and career development is another.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express excels at growing people. &quot;I think the best thing we do for our people is the program of promotion from within,&quot; says Perkins. &quot;Those promoted from within understand the culture and have been able to grow with the company. There is a tremendous amount of pride. Employees realize that they can achieve their personal objectives by helping the corporation achieve its objectives.&quot; The company never looks outside for people until it has conducted an exhaustive search for qualified company employees. More than 85% of the jobs are filled in house.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Searching for talent among 65,000 employees is no easy task. If you visit the Memphis hub late in the night, you will find employees glancing at the bulletin boards which list job opportunities in the Federal Express organization. Any qualified employee is free to apply for any job. The company also has a system called PRISM, which enables a manager to access information about an employee from any computer terminal. Via the terminal, the manager can update employee information or even effect a promotion. The idea is to eliminate the burden of paperwork, which often spoils performance appraisal systems, so proper attention is given to employee career development.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Employee expectations can be a serious bar to proper career planning. How many talented performers are promoted to managerial positions before either they or their supervisors realize that their talent for sales or production does not necessarily mean that they have the talent to make good managers. To minimize this problem, Federal Express offers a course on what it is like to be a manager. Any aspirant to a management position can take the course and decide if being a manager is really what they want. After taking the course, some decide that it is not, and save both themselves and the company frustration down the line. Even if the path to management is barred, there are always opportunities in other departments. In fact, Federal Express sometimes moves people around to introduce variety and reduce the burnout from job monotony. Customer service agents can apply for anything from an hour a day up to two years full-time work in other departments for a change of pace.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Organizational Values &amp; Skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organizational values such as teamwork and communication bring out higher level energies, both because they demand considerably greater effort and skill to establish and maintain and because they appeal to deeper seated sentiments in people and generate more intense satisfaction. The effort required to implement physical values is partially physical, i.e. based on hard work, and partially organizational, i.e. based on discipline, systematic functioning, coordination, etc. The skills required are also partly physical-knowing how to clean a window without leaving streaks or how to properly design and manufacturer a product for quality and reliability and partly organizational-knowing how to organize information or design an effective system.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By comparison, the effort required to implement organizational values is primarily organizational or social-dealing with groups of objects, activities, departments, systems and people. It is also partially psychological-instructing, guiding and motivating people. The skills required for implementing organizational values are of a higher order. They are not only organizational, but also interpersonal and psychological, for example giving a suggestion, receiving an instruction, and understanding people&#39;s attitudes and motives, and the dynamics of group interactions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Implementing organizational values is also more rewarding and enjoyable. When communication and cooperation between people, departments and levels of the company are better, people feel closer, more united and harmonious, more secure and more identified with the organization. These values touch deeper springs of energy in people and generate greater intensity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Teamwork</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Implementing organizational values has the power to release and channel great energy, regardless of how large or how small your business may be. John Stoneback, CEO of J &amp; M Incorporated in Cleveland, is a zealous proponent of teamwork. John founded this precision machining company 23 years ago. Until three years ago, J &amp; M had sales of just a few hundred thousand dollars a year, but was profitable enough to make John quite comfortable. Then John&#39;s daughter and son-in-law joined the company and suddenly the little nest egg was not big enough any more. So John decided to grow his company. One of the main instruments he used was teamwork.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Stoneback implemented teamwork through all the five stages outlined in the previous chapter. First, he made teamwork the first and highest priority-</span><span class="c4">commitment</span><span class="c8">. He got all his people involved in improving the company and working together in partnership-</span><span class="c4">structure</span><span class="c8">. He introduced a profit sharing plan that gave his employees a concrete sense of ownership in the company and a 40% share of the company&#39;s net income. He also conducted a survey asking his people to rate each other on their spirit of cooperation-</span><span class="c4">systems</span><span class="c3">. He drew up a plan to develop the interpersonal skills of every manager and supervisor and conducted training programs on team building. As a result of all these efforts, absenteeism decreased dramatically, while productivity, quality and on-time delivery improved. Over the last three years his company has grown 5.5 times in size to $1.5 million and has business in hand that could double its size again over the next two years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Bill Hockenberger is president of Precision Grinding and Manufacturing Corporation in Rochester, New York, a $10 million company with 125 employees. Over a three year period Bill struggled to put together a management team that really worked. In the process he made three separate attempts to bring in people who could work together and he failed three times. Finally he hired two psychologists to assist him with the task of building a solid management team. They started working with the management team and later extended it to include other managers and supervisors. Bill believes that this successful effort is directly responsible for his company&#39;s 25% increase in revenues and 50% increase in profits over the last one year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Teamwork was also the engine that propelled the growth of Elizabeth Carbide over the last one year. The company employs 170 people and has sales of $13 million. In recent years it opened several new production plants. A year ago, owner Rich Pagliari became concerned that the growth was having a negative impact on morale and people relationships. &quot;As you get bigger, communication becomes a problem,&quot; says Pagliari. So he sent 21 managers and supervisors to a Dale Carnegie course on team building and made efforts to improve communication and cooperation within and between his three plants. During the year his company&#39;s sales and profits both grew by another 25%. Pagliari attributes it directly to the team building effort.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">All the evidence suggests that high levels of teamwork and rapid growth go together. In our survey of U.S. companies cited earlier, high energy and high levels of teamwork were the two most common characteristics reported during periods of rapid growth. In addition, 76% of companies surveyed reported that during the period when teamwork and cooperation were at peak levels in their company, the company was also growing very rapidly. In other words,</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">teamwork is not just a characteristic of rapid growth, it can generate that growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Communication</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Communication and teamwork go together. They are both powerful energizers. Communication is a key value at Federal Express, where a corporate television network-</span><span class="c4">system</span><span class="c8">-has been established to facilitate rapid and direct communication between top management and every employee of the company about new products, competitive information, policies, plans, etc. One feature of each 30 minute to one hour TV show is a live phone-in segment in which employees&#39; questions and comments are answered by senior executives-</span><span class="c4">structure</span><span class="c8">. There are also daily 5 to 7 minute newscasts that relate current company news. Fred Smith explains the company&#39;s</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">commitment</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to communication this way.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;We try to empower our employees by keeping them well-informed. But just as importantly, by listening to them. We&#39;ve found that they have really terrific ideas about ways to improve productivity in their jobs, and about shaping policies that affect them. But we&#39;ve also found that the company must provide the opportunity for employee input or we&#39;ll never benefit from it. So we&#39;ve developed a variety of channels for listening to our employees.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For example, Federal Express conducts an annual employee attitude survey, which is a vital tool for helping managers surface potential problems in their work groups. Within six weeks after survey results are distributed, managers must meet with their staff and develop an action plan for dealing with every problem. Problems surface and problems are solved through survey feedback. The company&#39;s Guaranteed Fair Treatment policy is also designed for surfacing employee grievances. Any employee that is not satisfied by the response of his supervisor can pursue a path of appeal that ultimately leads to Fred Smith. Smith and Barksdale meet every week to review cases, many of which are referred to a board of review composed of the employee&#39;s own peers and empowered with the authority to overturn management decisions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In-house studies at Federal Express have shown that employee morale is directly linked with quality of service. Stations with the highest service performance records are those which have high morale, low absenteeism and few accidents.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Real communication takes place only when people fully understand the why and wherefore for the instructions they receive and are given an opportunity to respond with questions or comments. At Federal Express &quot;We explain to our employees why we do things,&quot; Perkins says. &quot;Our employees understand and are motivated beyond the point where they perform activities just because the boss said do it. They understand why they are asked to do something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Mirror Approach</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Paul Maestri came back to restore the values at P.A.M., communication was at the center of his strategy. He reopened the direct lines of communication with his drivers and made himself personally accessible to deal with serious grievances. But even more important, he took steps to institutionalize this value at lower levels of the company through appropriate standards, structures, systems and skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Maestri selected a new operations manager, Randy Berry, who was a very embodiment of the values Maestri believed in, particularly the value of teamwork. Berry understood the importance of listening to the drivers and started out by conducting training programs for all P.A.M. dispatchers to teach them the importance of listening and to provide them with the skills to do it effectively. For 30 to 60 days at a time, the drivers&#39; only link with the company is over the phone. So Berry trained the dispatchers to listen carefully to the drivers&#39; tone of voice and mood on the phone. Whenever the dispatchers detect the slightest problem, they have been trained to ask the drivers whether they need any help. Berry explains:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;You have to be a good listener. You have to listen to hear-not listen to argue. When we lost that approach for ten months, we had no lateral control of the drivers. The new management pressed the dispatchers for higher volumes and</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">didn&#39;t care about the people-only the results</span><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">. We weren&#39;t picking up and delivering on time. Driver morale went down and turnover increased. The dispatchers were not routing the drivers to ensure that they got home to their families every three weeks. The dispatchers were not relating to the drivers as people. I told the dispatchers to treat the drivers the way you would want to be treated yourself. Earn their respect. The general attitude of the drivers to the customers depends on how he feels about the company. Its a mirror image. The best way we can service our customers and be on time is to treat drivers well and see they feel good about P.A.M.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Berry also changed the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">structure</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">of his department, assigning each driver to a specific dispatcher regardless of which territory the driver moved through, instead of shifting responsibility from one dispatcher to another as the drivers moved to different parts of the country. This fostered closer and more personal ties. In addition to defining a clear structure of responsibility and accountability from the dispatcher all the way to Maestri and to imparting the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">skills</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">needed to make it work, P.A.M. also put in new</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">systems</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to foster better communication. A voice mail system enables drivers to call in and leave or receive messages without tieing up their time on the phone waiting for their dispatcher to be available. The result of focusing on teamwork and communication has been a dramatic reduction in P.A.M.&#39;s problems and a fresh burst of energy and rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE HIGHER POWERS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The first six strategies have focused on releasing the physical and social energies in our people for maximum productivity and involvement in work. We now come to the third and highest category, strategies designed to bring out the psychological energies of every individual and encourage each of them to grow personally through their work. These strategies have the power to take any company to the top of its field and keep it there for decades.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Individuals are more than just physical workers or members of the group. They each possess their own unique talents, capacities, skills, aspirations, values, ideas, attitudes and feelings. The truly people-oriented company is not the one that treats everyone alike, even in a family sort of way. It is the company that recognizes the uniqueness of every person and provides ample opportunities for each individual to express that uniqueness creatively in their work-for their personal growth and for the growth of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Recruiting for Higher Capacities</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Recruiting people with good physical health and energy energizes the company&#39;s physical operations. Recruiting people with cheerful, expansive, outgoing personalities and good interpersonal skills energizes the company&#39;s relationships with its customers and vendors and relationships between people and departments within the corporation. Recruiting people with higher levels of education and mental energy energizes the company&#39;s creative activities in research, marketing, strategic thinking, organizational development, and other areas of innovation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is true that only a small part of what is taught or learned in college has even the faintest application in business. But it is also true that education builds up the personality of the individual. Mental training in critical analysis of problems, exposure to a phenomenal range of information on a wide variety of subjects, stimulation and development of mental faculties by the effort to learn, and development of skills acquired for oral and written communication of ideas and information broaden the scope and intensify the energy of personality of the educated person. Therefore, recruiting for education, even when it does not bring with it greater practical knowledge or job-related information, almost always brings greater capacity of the person for understanding, problem-solving, adaptability to change and personal growth. These are great resources.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many companies recognize the irreplaceable contribution of education to the capacities of their people and encourage their employees to continuously seek further and higher levels of education throughout their careers. One medical representative we interviewed at Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme was in the process of acquiring his third masters degree since joining the company. AMRE not only encourages education, but has made it in some sense mandatory for its sales force. Every sales person is required to read at least one book a month and submit a summary of it to management.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Unfortunately, not too many CEOs act on their own understanding of the importance of continuing education. Yet, those who do have acknowledged it as among the most important management decisions they have made. When Listen Up started to grow explosively, Walt Stinson realized that the business was growing beyond his capacities to manage. He took a decision which perhaps very few could bring themselves to. He decided that however much it might slow down the company&#39;s short term growth, he was going to take time off to complement his technical background with an MBA, so that in the long run he would be able to keep growing as the company grew. After completing the MBA, Walt commented that, apart from proposing to his wife, it was the best decision he ever made.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many other executives have expressed similar sentiments about their decision to attend a course to augment their knowledge and skills. Buzz Jensen, founder of Sound Advice in Phoenix, was feeling intimidated by the numbers on his company&#39;s balance sheet, because he did not have any formal training in accounting. So he enrolled in a night school course on accounting for non-financial people and felt absolutely exhilarated by the sense of competence and accomplishment it gave him. Gary Ross, Chairman of Ross Incineration Services, and Bill Cromling, President of Ross Transportation, expressed similar feelings after enrolling in a Dale Carnegie course to help them improve their interpersonal skills and ability to communicate with their people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Experience</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Generalizations risk sounding simplistic or self-evident, but our observation of fast growing companies prompts us to make one. Companies which are able to grow rapidly and sustain high rates of growth for considerable periods of time are companies managed by people who have been through it all before. Companies which encounter innumerable problems in the course of their growth are usually those who are unable to anticipate the demands of growth and provide for them in advance, because management lacks the previous experience to know what is coming.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Before founding AMRE, Steve Bedowitz worked for one of the largest construction companies in Texas and ran his own advertising agency, which gave him a broad exposure to the operations and problems of other growth companies. Robert Levin came as a CPA with nine years experience in the wholesale end of the home improvements business, which gave him a good understanding of inventory management and financial controls. This experience has enabled them to visualize the company&#39;s future growth, anticipate its needs in advance and act to provide for them in time.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1985 when Bedowitz and Levin saw that business would double in a short period of time, during a slow period they decided to put in the next layer of management they would need six months down the line. If they had not done so, they figure they would have lost one year&#39;s growth. At the time of our visit to the company, they had recently recruited a new manager to head up the introduction of a new product group before the product had even been identified and at least half a year before it would be introduced into the market. That is the value of the experience they gained before starting the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Both education and experience have their place. The best strategy is to</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">recruit for education and experience wherever both are available; recruit for experience first wherever you desperately need it to get started or sustain growth; and recruit for education first wherever you are building for a bigger and better future.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Managerial &amp; Psychological Skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To be an effective manager you have to understand people and how to motivate them. You have to understand organization and how to develop it. In fact, you have to understand all five components of the company-how they work, how they interact with and depend on each other, and how they can be energized. How many managers really qualify for their jobs on these criteria?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many talented sales people have been promoted to managerial positions, because they were the best in sales. Many engineers have been promoted to become managers of R &amp; D or production, because they were technical experts. Many accountants have become controllers and even chief financial officers, because they were excellent accountants. Many senior executives have reached their positions, because they have been with the company for a long time and know all about its operations. All of these people may possess a high level of knowledge and technical skill in their particular fields of specialization. But what exactly does being a dynamic sales person, a talented designer, a good production engineer, a brilliant accountant or a long time employee have to do with understanding and motivating people? The same applies even to the CEO. On many occasions in the privacy of an executive office, we have heard CEOs ask questions like &quot;What is my job?&quot; and &quot;Am I really qualified to run this company?&quot; and &quot;How do I learn how to be a good CEO?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Regardless of whether it is the job of the production superintendent or the sales manager or the CEO, being a manager requires a wide range of skills that are not physical or technical in nature. A manager needs a host of mental and psychological skills like planning, prioritizing, analyzing and solving problems, goal setting, scheduling, exercising authority, decision-making, time management, seeing work from a wider perspective, listening, coordination, understanding and judging people, which he or she may have acquired in the course of his specialized job or through long experience, but equally likely not at all. That is why IBM requires every manager in the company, including senior executives heading large divisions, to undergo a minimum of 40 hours a year of non-technical training in interpersonal and managerial skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">John Kaiser of Expeditors International has recognized the challenge which he and his company face as it continues to grow:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">It is difficult to find well-trained professionals in this industry. We try to educate our people and ourselves. We&#39;ve tried to broaden our horizons.</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">Our challenge is not to know the business better, but to manage it better</span><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">. We are very much aware of a need for greater managerial sophistication. I am not sure that our present staff could run a $500 million company. We hope that as managers we will be able to grow. If you are top management, you have no one to nurture you. Possibly some of our younger managers have a better chance at running the company as a $500 million business, because they have formal education. When you get this big, it may be necessary to have both experience and education.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Earlier we cited several examples to document the obvious importance of experience in managing a business. But what happens, as in Expeditor&#39;s case, if experienced people are not available in your company&#39;s specialized field or in the numbers required to fuel further growth? Our response is-</span><span class="c4">if you cannot find experience, create it!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Accelerated Management Development</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Small entrepreneurial companies suffer from a perpetual shortage of skilled and experienced managers to fill the new positions they create as they grow. Fast growing mid-sized companies are continuously hampered and constrained by a lack of talented managers to fill their growing ranks. Nor does this situation exist only in companies up to a few hundred million dollars in size. Among the largest and most admired companies in the U.S., there are many whose single greatest limitation to growth is a shortage of competent managers. Yet despite this fact, surprisingly few, even today, act on the truth which IBM proved half a century ago-any capable individual can be made into a competent manager through appropriate training.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Suppose just for a moment that every managerial position in your company could be filled by a person with the managerial competence of the CEO or senior executives? What would that do to the performance of your business? What would be the impact on product quality? service? punctuality? morale? decision-making? revenues? profitability? Where would your company be today and a year from now if it possessed managerial expertise of that calibre? Think about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These questions are not as academic or utopian as they may at first seem. Ask yourself, what is the difference between a highly experience senior executive and a young, well-educated MBA occupying a junior managerial position in sales, marketing or product development? What does the experienced person have which the others lack? Three things: information, skill and values. The experienced senior executive has acquired a tremendous amount of information about the industry, the history of the company, competitors, technology and the like. The experienced person has also by sheer efflux of time and practice acquired a range of skills in understanding, communicating and motivating people, analyzing and resolving problems, managing time and materials, etc. Finally and most importantly, over the course of many years the executive has learned by experience the importance of corporate values like cleanliness, orderliness, punctuality, systematic functioning, coordination, respect for the individual, integrity, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The question is whether these qualifications of the senior executive can be acquired all or in part through formal training. Information? Most certainly. Our entire educational system is geared up to cram us brim full of information, relevant or irrelevant, on virtually any subject under the sun. Just because the information which the senior executive possesses is not taught in any business school, does not mean it cannot be taught formally by the company itself. Skills? Most surely. If physicians can learn how to operate on the brain in medical school and aspiring actors and actresses can learn how to feign any emotion in drama classes, then basic managerial skills like problem-solving, planning, decision-making, delegating, giving instructions, negotiating and managing time can be acquired through formal training-and they are by many people. Then what about corporate values? Definitely. Cultural and social values have been taught for millennia at home and by the church. The importance of corporate values like cleanliness, speed, teamwork and service are being taught every day-only not to everyone, and not systematically.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now suppose every young manager in your company could acquire in a year or even two the information, skills and values possessed by your senior executives to the extent of 90%, 80% or even 70%. How much more efficient, dynamic, energetic and profitable would your company be? How much greater would be its potentials for growth in the immediate future? Certainly to speak of a mere doubling or tripling of sales or profits grossly underestimates the potential this represents for most companies. Yet, the cost and effort required to build up that competence is well within the means of most companies to accomplish at their level. And if they do, they will certainly not be at that same level very long.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is the guiding principle behind Federal Express&#39;s management development programs, which it first introduced in 1976, and the Leadership Institute which the company established to accelerate the development of managers to keep pace with the growth of the company. Federal Express has even conducted research to determine the profile of the successful manager and leader in its corporate environment. This program has enabled the company to promote relatively young managers to vice-presidential positions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pygmalion Effect: The Power of Attitude</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Education, experience, managerial and psychological skills are tremendous strengths. Yet as great as these powers are, every CEO, every executive, every manager and supervisor possesses a capacity infinitely more powerful, which they can utilize without cost any time they choose or all the time, if they choose. This capacity by itself is enough to energize any business to double its performance. It is the power of personal attention.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Educators and psychologists have given a lot of thought and study to this power, because it is so important to the process of learning and personal development. They have even coined a phrase to describe it, the Pygmalion Effect. The name is derived from George Bernard Shaw&#39;s play,</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Pygmalion</span><span class="c8">, which formed the basis for the Broadway musical</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">My Fair Lady</span><a id="id.drq33q7kit1a"></a><span class="c3">. In the play, two linguistic experts, Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering, successfully undertake an experiment to instruct a poor common flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, how to speak and conduct herself as a lady and member of the aristocracy. After the miraculous transformation has taken place, Eliza remarks with some bitterness to Colonel Pickering:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">The difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she&#39;s treated. I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because he treats me as a flower girl and always will, but I know I can be a lady to you, because you always treat me as a lady and always will.</span><span class="c15 c17">20</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In other words, our attitude and attention have the power to create in other people or bring forth from them capacities no one ever imagined they possess.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">About 25 years ago two social scientists conducted an experiment in an elementary school to test for the Pygmalion Effect. They told the teachers in the school that they had developed a test which could identify late bloomers, poor performing students with a high aptitude who would flower as high performers in later years. Actually the test was a measure of IQ. At the beginning of the school year, they administered the test, went back to their offices and randomly selected the names of 20% of the students in each class. Then they informed the teachers that these students were late bloomers. Eight months later they went back and measured the IQ of the students again. Guess which students showed the largest increase in IQ? Those whom the teachers had been told were late bloomers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This experiment shows that the expectations or attitude of the teacher toward the students had a significant impact on the students&#39; performance and even on their intelligence! Over the last quarter century, the same experiment has been administered in many different settings, including a training institute for welders in Sweden. Here the instructors were informed that their test would identify students with an innate talent for welding! Sure enough at the end of the year, the students which had been randomly identified had made the most progress.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If the power of attention can raise the IQ of young students and improve the skill of welders, it can improve the performance of every employee in your company. You as a manager, as an individual, possess that power and can exercise it to bring out the hidden potentials and develop the capacities of your people. Your managers and their subordinates also possess that power and can in turn use it to help their own people flower. In fact, if you look closely at companies that continue to perform at high levels year after year, you will find that these are companies which knowingly or unknowingly believe in the power of attention and encourage their managers to shower it on their people for the growth of those people and the growth of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Federal Express&#39;s Karl Birkholz describes just such an attitude: &quot;One thing that has helped us throughout all this pressure of rapid growth has been an undying dedication to making sure we pay attention to the needs of our people... You have to teach your managers to know your people. The better you know them, the better you can motivate them. That is the manager&#39;s job.&quot; Jim Reidmeyer, former senior vice president of Air Operations, put it this way: &quot;My job is to make sure that</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">everyone</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">who works for me is successful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">But you may say, I am always and forever giving attention to my employees. True, but</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">there is a subtle and important distinction that should be made between taking interest in employees for the sake of accomplishing work and taking interest in them for their own sake as individuals.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;That is the difference between social recognition and personal attention and the reason why personal attention is so much more powerful. Far greater power emerges when we shift the focus from the work to the individual and shift the motive from getting things done to just plain giving attention to another human being.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Attitudes have extraordinary power. Changing an attitude can release phenomenal energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Psychological Values</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every industry and every economy goes through phases of growth and recession. Most every company goes through similar phases of expansion and contraction or leveling, and the large majority disappear after some time. Based on past trends, out of every 100 companies started this year, less than 20% will still be in business five years from now; and of those 20%, only 20% will be in business five years later.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet despite these facts, there are companies that not only survive Great Depressions, major and minor recessions, economic cycles for the nation and their industry, but continue to grow through it all, year after year, decade after decade, even when their industry is taking a tail spin or the economy is in a dive. That is because these companies have succeeded in tapping and releasing some of the deepest springs of human energy-the energy generated by commitment to psychological values like respect for the individual, personal growth, harmony and service to society.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1932 when 25% of the workforce was unemployed and companies were casting off workers as unwanted liabilities, Tom Watson made a commitment to every IBM employee guaranteeing them their jobs as long as the company remained afloat. That commitment to a high corporate value powerfully energized people throughout the company from the production floor to the sales counter and drove the growth of IBM from fifth to first place in its industry within seven years . Respect for and commitment to the individual are so powerful.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Personal Growth</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Even more powerful is commitment to the value of personal growth for your people. Much of what we have been discussing in the last part of this chapter relates to the personal growth and development of people, not so much in the external sense of the term-which is commonly understood as increased compensation and promotions-but in a deeper, more inward sense-which relates to the development of their physical, social, mental and emotional capacities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Personal growth of this description occurs all the time in work. It takes place unconsciously and very gradually. Each new experience, positive or negative, broadens and deepens the personality. Each new skill acquired increases our sense of competence and self-esteem. But this unconscious process is usually so slow and sporadic that the amount of energy generated is not significant. The process can be accelerated and magnified by a conscious corporate effort and programs, so that individuals are continuously acquiring new mental and psychological skills, being exposed to new learning experiences, and being given opportunities to grow by taking on challenging responsibilities like Dave Gray at Nedlloyd.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unleashing the Creative Powers of Individuality</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter we have been examining strategies to release people&#39;s physical, social, emotional and mental energies in work. The greatest of these energies is the inner urge or aspiration in each person to develop his or her own unique individuality. It is that energy which provides the driving force for the entrepreneurial spirit that has made this nation so creative and productive. Presently organizations are so structured that one or a few people at the top release the creative energies of their individuality, while tens, hundreds or thousands of other people are only permitted or encouraged to express the lesser energies of their personalities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imagine, what would be impact on your company if these creative energies, which lie within every person, could be released in all or many of those who presently follow the dictates and execute the inspiration of one or a few leaders? Then instead of the company being propelled forward by the force of a few people at the top, it could develop 10, 100 or 1000 engines of growth powerful enough to propel it to 10, 100 or 1,000 times its present size. That possibility is the essential truth behind the concept of &quot;intrapreneurship&quot;-creating entrepreneurs within corporations-but so far it is more an idea and far less a reality in American enterprise.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The keys for that achievement are right attitude and freedom. The attitude required is one of genuine, deep appreciation for the incredible creativity and resourcefulness of the human being and the willingness to give people the freedom to express that endowment. Individuality can only flower in an atmosphere of freedom. Companies that function from above downward through authority may be very efficient, but they can never match the vitality and intensity of a company that releases even a little of this ultimate power. Glimpses of this power can be seen in companies like Apple Computers during the first flush of their growth. Any company that succeeds-even to a small degree-in sustaining an atmosphere where every individual has an opportunity to flower can plan to double itself, not once or on occasion, but double every year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ACTION PLAN FOR ENERGIZING PEOPLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Use the strategies listed below to develop action plans to unleash the powers of your people.

The wheel enabled men and women to transport heavy loads and travel long distances. The sextant permitted ships to leave their coastal routes, venture out into the uncharted oceans, explore new continents and open up worldwide sea trade. The invention of the printing press became the impetus for universal education. The steam engine ushered in the industrial revolution. The electric bulb, the locomotive, the automobile, the telephone and the computer have all played revolutionary roles in the development of civilization. But the greatest invention of them all is something without which virtually all these other discoveries would be rendered almost useless. That something is organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If the component people has been perceived as the greatest engine of growth by many companies, organization has been perceived as the greatest obstacle and constraint to that growth. Organization is the least appreciated, least admired of the five components. Almost everyone seems to be against it. There are outspoken, zealous advocates of the importance of people, market, technology and even capital. But being anti-establishment, anti-bureaucracy and anti-organization has become respectable and even fashionable. Yet, the fact is that organization contains the deepest secrets and greatest unutilized potentials for the rapid growth of your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization is the power that brings the other four components together, unites them and makes them productive. Without some type of organization, people cannot work together toward a common goal, money cannot be productively invested, technology cannot be developed or applied on a large scale, and markets cannot develop beyond the level of barter trade between individuals. We tend to regard technology as the real driving force for the evolution of society from the primitive to the modern era. But the entire development of civilization has actually been made possible by the evolution of larger, more complex, more efficient and more innovative types of organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In Chapter Two we described how two American entrepreneurs with a small amount of capital started a business in Brussels in a low-tech industry which is thousands of years old and utilized unskilled hourly wage-earners to build up a global network of consumer service centers. There was nothing extraordinary about the market they tapped, the technology they utilized, the people they recruited or the financial resources they invested. The real power that has propelled the phenomenal growth of Minit International is organization. Organization enabled this company to create a new delivery system to meet an ancient need. Organization enabled the company to expand the scale of what had previously been a tiny localized business into a global operation. Organization enabled it to revive a dying industry and convert it into a rapidly growing and very profitable field of activity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This organization consisted of a highly decentralized management and supervisory structure, detailed standard operating procedures to define every major and minor activity of the service centers, sophisticated management information systems for centralized monitoring of performance by service units, regions and countries, close coordination of every activity in the chain of production from procurement of raw materials and fabrication of service center machinery to recruitment and training of supervisors and workers. Minit International put in place the right structure, systems, and well-synchronized activities to expand almost effortlessly around the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ORGANIZATON: THE LEVER</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What is the essential difference between the CEO of a $1 million company and the CEO of a $1 billion or a $50 billion company? The CEO of the larger company is not 1,000 times bigger, more intelligent, or more experienced than his $1 million counter-part. Then what enables the one CEO to produce 1,000 more revenues and perhaps 1,000 times greater profits than the other? Organization. Organization enables an individual to extend himself infinitely in space and time, to perform thousands of actions simultaneously and to accomplish work on a scale that is impossible for any individual or group of individuals, no matter how large their number, to accomplish without it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Greek philosopher Archimedes once said, &quot;If you give me a lever that is long enough and a fulcrum to rest it upon, I can lift the earth.&quot; Organization is such a lever and fulcrum. With it any company can rise to the top of its industry locally, nationally or even internationally. The one technology that is most essential to non-stop growth is the technology of organization. Organization is a toolbox filled with powerful levers that can elevate and energize market, people, technology and capital to unimaginable heights. The aim of this chapter is to explore the secrets of some powerful instruments in the organizational toolbox.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think of a time when it was the most fun to work in your company. More than likely it was a time when the organization you had in place was well-suited to the size and nature of your business. When organization is right, work is expansive, smooth-running and enjoyable.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">WHAT&#39;S WRONG WITH ORGANIZATION?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If organization is as wonderful as we say it is, why then is it so maligned and misunderstood? There are five reasons. The first is because of the five components, its powers are the least visible and its actions the least dramatic, while its inadequacies are highly visible and its failures to act are directly felt by everyone. Few people are conscious of its powers, though everyone benefits from them. Organization is not something physical like people, money, a product or a customer that can be seen or touched. When it is most effective, it is least noticed and felt. On the other hand, because it is so pervasive and so essential, when it breaks down or malfunctions, everyone knows it and feels it and everything grinds to a halt.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The accusation most frequently raised against organization is that it stifles individual initiative and creativity. But in actuality, organization is the most creative of the five components. Creativity means to combine things in new ways to generate new results. Organization is constantly creating new combinations of people, actions, systems, capital, technology and market needs. In fact, without organization the full creative potentials of the other four components could never be realized. The most creative organizations bring out the greatest creativity from the other four. At the end of this chapter we return to the issue of how to make your organization most alive and creative.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What then of the bureaucracy which encumbers our operations, demotivates our people, turns off customers, and blissfully disregards new technology? Bureaucracy is all too real and pervasive. But bureaucracy has nothing to do with any inherent deficiency in the powers of organization. It has everything to do with the inadequacies in the way we use those powers. Just like the typewriter we curse at for typing the wrong letter or the computer program we blame for not behaving as it should, even though we have not read the manual, we reproach organization for our imperfections. When organization breaks down, the first impulse of every entrepreneur and many managers is to throw it to the wind and act on inspiration or impulse.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That brings us to the third reason organization is held in disfavor, one that strikes even closer to home: most companies and most managers are not very good at it. We have lots of motivating leaders, brilliant technocrats, financial wizards and marketing geniuses, but not too many entrepreneurs and executives who are really masters of the technology of organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The fourth reason organization is so often disparaged is that it has no defenders, no constituency and no special interest group lobbying for its needs, because no one has been made responsible for it. Most companies can clearly identify one or more persons or departments responsible for the development of the other four components-market, finance, technology and people. But what about organization? Who in your company is responsible for organization and its development? In a vast majority of companies the answer is &quot;no one&quot; or &quot;everyone&quot;, which usually amount to the same thing. Sure, many companies have departments responsible for administration or management information systems, which are important elements of organization. But these areas represent only a tiny portion of the component.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The final reason is that to a large extent organization is a free resource. It requires relatively little or no investment in comparison with the returns it gives. Most companies are so preoccupied with caring for their &quot;interests&quot; that they ignore their greatest opportunities. If every company had to pay a licensing or patent fee for organizational technology, the way they do for computer software, perhaps this powerful software would be much better utilized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For all these reasons most companies think of organization more like Achilles&#39; heel than Archimedes&#39; lever. This is especially true when companies are growing rapidly. It is relatively easy to increase production to meet increased market demand. The addition of new people during rapid expansion is usually a manageable task, even when the numbers are large. But most companies find that building up an organization while growing rapidly is like trying to repair an aircraft in mid-air. That is why so many of the negative characteristics of rapid growth reported in Chapter Five directly relate to organization, or rather the absence of adequate organization-chaos and confusion, breakdown of systems, internal conflicts, poor coordination and poor communication. Learning to grow your organization rapidly and properly is the single greatest challenge faced by companies aspiring for non-stop growth, and it is one of the most valuable skills that a manager or a company can acquire. As a senior executive of one fast growing company put it: &quot;Nobody has yet addressed the fact that as we go to the next level of size, we have a major problem in managing this business.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HOW DO ORGANIZATIONS GROW?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">People grow by releasing greater energy in themselves, improving their knowledge, acquiring new skills, changing their attitudes and committing themselves to higher values. How then do organizations grow?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It sounds like a simple question. But all the problems companies face with building an organization arise from the fact that the real process by which organizations grow is somewhat of a mystery. It is easy to describe the growth of an organization as the creation of new positions, new departments, new divisions or new layers of management. That is simple enough. We can visualize it. We can depict it on an organizational chart. But that is a very superficial conception and a dangerous one. For the moment we imagine that the only thing we have to do to grow our organization is increase the number of positions, our organization begins to lose power and degenerate into a bureaucracy. Growth in size is not the same thing as growth in power and creativity-either for the physical body or the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our goal is to generate greater energy, productivity and creativity from the organization, not to lose what we already have. Where then is that energy to come from? How does an organization grow more efficient and effective, more powerful and creative?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE THREE BUILDING BLOCKS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The mystery of organization arises from the fact that we are so familiar with its basic elements, we take them for granted. To acquire mastery over the powers of organization, it is necessary to approach them freshly with the innocence and curiosity of a child discovering something wondrous for the first time. Only then do their real potentials clearly emerge.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter we propose to look at the organization of your company and determine how suited it is to achieve the company&#39;s growth and profit goals. We begin by looking at the fundamental principles upon which every organization is based and from which it derives its powers and potentials. Our objective is to identify the untapped powers, the gaps and missing links which when supplied will give greater energy, life and creativity to your organization and your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;Organization consists of three basic subunits:</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">1. </span><span class="c4">Positions</span><span class="c3">. The basic subunit of organizational structure is the individual job position. Positions are grouped together to form teams, departments, task forces, offices, regions, divisions, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">2. </span><span class="c4">Activities</span><span class="c3">. The basic subunit of functioning is the individual act. Hundreds of individual acts are linked together to form major and minor activities, such as purchasing, recruiting, production, estimating, sales, advertising, meetings, correspondence, accounting, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">3. </span><span class="c4">Systems</span><span class="c8">. Systems are the subunits which connect positions with each other, activities with each other, and positions and activities together.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The key to the growth of organization lies in understanding how each of these subunits develops and how they interact with one another to form an organic whole, which is capable of life, growth and creativity. In order to understand how organizations grow in power and effectivity, we must first understand how jobs, activities and systems grow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ANALYZING YOUR JOB</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Structure answers the questions: Who is responsible? Who has authority? The structure of a company consists of many individual positions ranked in orderly relationship to one another. Let us begin by looking at your job and asking some basic questions:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are your responsibilities clear to yourself and other people?</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Each job consists of certain responsibilities and a certain measure of authority to carry them out. The clarity of those responsibilities has a major impact on how each individual performs as part of a greater whole, the organization, and how the organization performs in relationship to the individual. When Marty Wiegel, CEO of Wiegel Tool Works in Wood Dale, Illinois, asked himself this basic question, he realized where a lot of his frustrations and problems originated. He and two other senior executives all had responsibility for dealing with customers and coordinating their needs with the estimating, engineering and production departments. As a result, these departments were receiving independent and often directly contradictory instructions from the three people at the top. Whenever one of the three executives complained to a department manager that something had gone wrong, the manager blamed poor performance on the conflicting priorities established by those above or on the lack of cooperation from other departments, which were functioning according to different priorities set by one of the other executives. Each of the three executives held each other accountable for the confusion. Once Wiegel became fully conscious of where the problem lay, he redefined his own job and that of the other executives to eliminate the ambiguity and confusion. Setting right this tiny component of his organization helped Wiegel increase sales 27% from $4.5 million to $5.7 million and to raise profits by 40% in one year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Of course, such basic ambiguities never occur in larger companies! A few years ago we called one of the nation&#39;s largest banks to negotiate a loan for an $80 million industrial project in India. When we asked the switchboard operator to connect us with the department responsible for industrial investment in foreign projects, we were connected to the real estate division. From there we were passed from department to department-a total of at least ten by our then blurry-eyed reckoning-before we finally reached the appropriate executive in the right department, who belatedly expressed great interest in our proposal. Contrast this with a similar experience we had at IBM, when we called to discuss a proposal for collaboration with India, where IBM does not even operate since its withdrawal in 1974. The switchboard operator immediately connected us to the appropriate vice-president, whose secretary informed us he was home sick and promised to get back to us shortly. Within 24 hours we were meeting with the one individual in the company most qualified to discuss our proposal, the former general manager of IBM&#39;s India division.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is not a discussion concerning switchboard operators-which might merit a book of its own. It is about the clarity of structure in your company at all levels from the CEO and management team down to the lowest level foreman or supervisor; from corporate headquarters out into the stores, offices and plants; between departments, branches, regions, and divisions. It is not enough that you, your close associates and subordinates understand who is responsible for what in the company. In order for structure to support smooth functioning, clarity should extend to everyone. How many companies can pass the test which Wiegel and the bank failed? How much frustration and confusion is generated, how much energy is wasted by a mere lack of clearly defined jobs-energy that could be converted into greater sales and higher profits? Think about your job, the jobs of senior executives and department managers. How many pass the simple test for clarity?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Does authority match responsibility?</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If a job description does not already exist for your position, make a list of your major responsibilities. Now list down the actual levels and types of authority assigned to your job. Do they match? Do you have the authority to perform all the responsibilities? Think about the jobs of the people who report directly to you. Do their responsibilities and levels of authority match? Problems frequently arise in areas where lower level managers are responsible for meeting schedule deadlines, yet are dependent on higher level approvals at various points in the process. In one company project management was running an average of six months behind on a multitude of large projects to expand the production facility. When called to task for the delays, the manager pointed out that virtually every project was awaiting clearances and approvals from senior executives who were in meetings all day and unavailable to their subordinates.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Contrast this with the amazing achievement of Bajaj Auto Limited of India, which constructed a new $180 million motorscooter plant in 18 months-a credible accomplishment in any country, a miracle under Indian conditions! Rahul Bajaj appointed a single executive engineer as sole responsible and fully empowered authority for the project and met with him just once a month for a progress report. As the project neared completion, the biggest constraint became the inability of the local government to get approval and allocation of funds for a new telephone exchange to service the plant. In order to meet the schedule, the executive engineer constructed the government facility at company expense and was reimbursed after the plant was commissioned. That is the power of a proper blend of authority and responsibility.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To what extent do responsibilities and authority match in your company?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Are you sure you are doing what you should be doing?</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">An important distinction needs to be made between the responsibilities assigned to a position and the actual tasks carried out by the person in that job. For example, the CEO of a small company or the vice president of a larger firm may accept responsibility for personally replying to all customer complaints. But that does not necessarily mean Bill Marriott personally writes or types each letter himself. Yet more than one CEO and executive we have met interpret the responsibility in that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Job Analysis</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ask virtually any senior executive to carry out a thorough analysis of the way they actually spend their time, i.e. the physical tasks they perform, not the responsibilities they are in charge of. For each of those tasks, ask whether it could be more cost-effectively performed at a lower level of the company without sacrificing quality. The answer in many cases is &quot;Yes.&quot; Now split those tasks into their component parts and ask whether any of the components could be carried out just as well or better and more cost-effectively at a lower level. The answer is almost always &quot;Yes.&quot; After moaning and groaning about the arduous nature of the exercise, executives usually come back smiling and say as one dedicated and hard-working vice president did &quot;I never realized before how much time I could save. I can free up 50% of my time for the design and construction of our new production facility.&quot; A vice president of marketing found he could free up 25% of his time from administrative tasks to go out and meet the company&#39;s Fortune 500 customers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The same type of rationalization can be done at every level of an organization from top to bottom. It is most effective when it starts at the very top and moves down level after level. What are the savings in terms of efficient use of people that can be achieved by this one strategy? A few years ago, Ford Motors asked white-collar workers in some units to list all the things they do in a month, rank the duties, and stop doing the bottom 20%. This analysis has saved the company hundreds of millions of dollars a year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">By analyzing jobs, established companies usually discover, like Ford, that they can do more work with the same people or the same work with fewer people. On the other hand, young growth oriented companies usually discover that they are trying to do too much with the existing people and that key responsibilities needed to sustain high rates of growth cannot be properly handled without adding new positions at one level or another.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How about you? How can your company, your department or your career grow, unless you can find ways to accomplish more work more effectively in the same amount of time? The first exercise at the end of this chapter outlines a ten-step process to analyze and grow your job and the jobs of your people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DELEGATION AND INTEGRATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Job analysis is a powerful tool for the company to improve organizational efficiency and for the manager to grow in personal effectiveness. It also reveals part of the process by which organizations grow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">When a manager succeeds in improving his effectiveness and taking on higher responsibilities by delegating less important tasks to people at lower levels, he makes individual progress and rises in the organization. That is the process of personal growth. When the manager succeeds in creating a capacity in people at a lower level to do the same work with the same skill and quality under his guidance and authority, the organization progresses. That is the process of organizational growth. In other words,</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">an organization grows when it is able to carry out a higher level or a wider scale of activity at a lower level of the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The process of growing jobs is commonly referred to as delegation. Most people think of delegation as transferring a task or responsibility to a subordinate, but that is only half the story. Delegation becomes fully effective only when the tasks undertaken at different levels are properly integrated with one another.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Integration means to harmonize the activities of all the levels, so they work together smoothly to achieve a common purpose.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;When delegation is accompanied by integration, the company is able to continuously push tasks to lower levels to improve efficiency, while ensuring that the activities carried out at different levels stay in harmony with one another. Integration is the real foundation for the growth of organization, because it enables organization to continuously transfer tasks to lower levels and yet at the same time ensure a common direction to activities carried out at different levels. Integration is the most powerful of any organizational values. The key to integration is effective delegation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">FOUR RULES OF DELEGATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Delegation is one of the most important activities an organization has to manage in order to grow. A failure in this area can absolutely stop the growth process, as it has for many companies, or lead it quickly to crisis or ruin. Yet, regardless of whether you speak to the CEO or executive of a $1 million company or a $1 billion company, the responses are surprisingly similar.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Few managers will quarrel with the idea of delegating physical tasks. But the heart of delegation is delegating decisions, i.e. responsibility and authority. That is a different matter. Many sincere executives genuinely believe that no one else can take the decisions they are taking with equal or near equal effectiveness. In most cases they are probably right. But delegation does not mean just giving decision-making responsibility into someone else&#39;s hands. It means building up the capabilities of the organization, so that someone at a lower level can assume the responsibility with equal effectiveness.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When asked to identify the first step in effective delegation, most managers respond: &quot;Find the right person.&quot; We disagree.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Institutionalize your skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The first step in effective delegation is to identify the knowledge, guidelines or thought processes which you utilize in making a decision and create a system for evaluating alternatives. By this process, the individual imparts his or her personal capacity to the organization. He institutionalizes his skill.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The CEO of a very profitable and fast growing industrial leasing company once told us that at $18 million, his company had reached the limits of growth possible for it. His rationale was that he was already spending 16 hours a day at the office, a good part of it reviewing lease proposals prepared by his staff of qualified MBAs, and there simply was no more time in the day available. When asked whether any one else in the company could approve the lease proposals, he immediately ran off half a dozen very convincing examples of wrong recommendations made by his staff that could have led to disastrous consequences, had he not reviewed and overturned them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.1r90f2y6l0jb"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">After listening patiently to his description of the process, we confronted him with the following challenge. &quot;We believe it is possible for you to create a system that will not only take decisions as effectively as you do, but actually more effectively; because it will ask all the right questions all the time, whereas you ask most of the right questions most of the time.&quot; The CEO accepted the challenge. Six months later he reported that his company was again growing rapidly and as profitably as before. According to his own assessment, he had succeeded in creating a system which actually did a better job than he did of evaluating lease proposals.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As Jan Carlzon of SAS put it:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;A leader is not appointed because he knows everything and can make every decision. He is appointed to bring together the knowledge that is available and then create the prerequisites for the work to be done.</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">He creates the systems that enable him to delegate responsibility for day-to-day operations.&quot;</span><span class="c15 c17">21</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is difficult to conceive, but most managers never think of asking how their counterparts in larger companies are able to manage much larger operations than they without sacrificing the quality of decisions. It never occurred to the CEO of one mold manufacturer that he could create a system for estimating the cost and price on new jobs, until he heard three of his competitors talk about the systems they had developed in order to delegate estimating and keep growing. The CEO of a 30-unit hotel chain, who felt he had reached the limits of growth possible for his company, was surprised to learn how Willard Marriott had solved the same problems 25 years earlier. The real limitation is attitude. The moment we give in to the suggestion-whether our own or someone else&#39;s-that we are the only ones who can do it right, we put a lid on our own growth, both personal and corporate.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Harry Patten had a real knack for identifying rural properties suitable for development into homesites and he used to fly in his corporate plane to view every potential site for acquisition. That was alright at a time when Patten Corporation&#39;s activities were confined to a handful of offices in New England. But how could the CEO of a fast growing company spend all his time roaming the country to identify new sites and still manage the growth of his business. Patten analyzed the critical variables that go into selecting good sites, trained others to understand his approach and institutionalized the process of evaluating and acquiring new properties. Today there are over 50 specialists in offices throughout the Eastern and Midwestern United States selecting sites for the company. Patten institutionalized his skill so that both he and the organization could grow...and grow they did-from $11 million in 1985 to $116 million in 1988.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Identify the right people and train them</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now is the time to find the right people and give them a thorough training in how decisions should be made. The CEO of a $150 million company once remarked, &quot;Delegation? I have no problem at all in delegating. My only problem is that when delegation fails, I have to take back the task again.&quot; Delegation usually fails for one or four reasons. The right person is not selected. The right system is not in place. The right training is not given. Or the rules, guidelines and expectations of the person delegating are not properly communicated to the person receiving the charge.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Who is the right person? First of all, the right person is one who has the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">ability</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">to undertake the work-the right knowledge, skills and capacity for acting according to the guidelines you have established and through the system you have created. Second, and equally important, the right person is someone who has the</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">time</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">to undertake the work-whose present job is not so demanding that additional work results in burnout, errors or lapses in other areas of responsibility. It sounds obvious enough. But very commonly delegation breaks down, because we pass tasks on without first assessing what will be the impact of the additional work on the beneficiary. In other words, you cannot effectively rationalize your own job without also analyzing the jobs of those who report to you and making it possible for them to rationalize their jobs as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Delegate and Monitor</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Paul Maestri learned this rule the hard way. When he brought in the new executive team and delegated authority, he walked away and never looked back, i.e. he delegated without any type of monitoring or control. Delegation without control is abdication. Effective delegation requires a feedback system to monitor performance on a regular basis. As Karlberg explained it, &quot;One of the problems we had when the new management team came in was that there were no systems in place to measure the performance of delegation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The importance of monitoring sounds obvious, but this is shaky ground. Very often monitoring is the door through which managers, knowingly or unknowingly, take back the decisions they have given away. The real issue is-&quot;What should I monitor?&quot; That brings us to the fourth important rule.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monitor the results, not the actions</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">How many times have you heard a manager say-or perhaps heard yourself say-&quot;I delegated the responsibility, but he is doing it the wrong way,&quot;-meaning he is not doing it the way the manager would have done it. That is not delegation. Delegation means to instruct someone what result you want to achieve and then leave that person free to determine the best way to achieve that result. The result may be both quantitative and qualitative, e.g. reduce production costs by 10% without sacrificing quality. As long as the result is achieved, hands off!</span><a id="id.ol5kb9y19du1"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">As Carlzon said, &quot;The result-oriented leader does not dictate the methods for achieving the results...&quot;</span><span class="c15">22</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Many executives struggle with this principle. But unless it is followed, delegation almost invariably is reduced to second-guessing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Delegation requires a psychological effort</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is the crux of the matter. Bruce Phelps, CEO of Fulton Tool Company, summed up the problem of delegation wonderfully: &quot;The real problem of delegation is to stop doing a thing after you have delegated it!&quot; As Steve Bedowitz candidly remarked, &quot;The hardest thing is not being hands on everyday...&quot; The hardest part about delegating is to stop wanting to do what you know that someone else can do in your place.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The CEO of a $500 million manufacturing company complained: &quot;I keep telling my executives to take decisions and act. But at every weekly production meeting, they ask me what I think. Then I ask a few questions. Before you know it I have reversed or seconded their decision and the responsibility is back in my lap.&quot; After some thought the CEO added, &quot;I guess the truth is I really like to take the decisions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Delegation requires many skills-in judging people properly, in communicating with them, in creating effective systems, etc. But delegation also requires a psychological effort to give up what you have delegated-to grow and let someone else grow too. Fred Smith knows what that effort is like:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;I&#39;ve tried to give people who are in positions of authority lots of freedom, so they can be creative. That&#39;s the hardest thing to do, because it takes a lot of discipline. You want to insert yourself in lots of things, where you don&#39;t have any business getting involved or where you want to protect people from themselves or to protect the organization from the people. You&#39;ve got to give people some degree of right to fail.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DELEGATION AND CORPORATE GROWTH</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Everyone likes to be considered indispensable. But being indispensable puts a limit on our growth, because the company can never afford to take away from us what we already know and do well. Which means, in that measure there is no opportunity for us to learn new things, acquire new skills and master other fields of activity. The really indispensable executive is the one who constantly makes himself dispensable, so that others can take over his job and he can grow onwards and upwards.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Delegation is not merely an important management skill by which managers improve their efficiency and accomplish more work. It is part of the process by which companies evolve to higher and higher levels of organization. Through delegation, the structure of the company is constantly changing, even when the positions and titles remain the same. Delegation enables the CEO, the management team and managers at all levels to continuously redefine their jobs and the acts which they perform. Delegation, at the micro-level of the individual job and task, enables a company to instill a culture of perpetual change that ensures freshness and prevents the organization from becoming old, static and bureaucratic.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">A perpetual process of delegation enables a company to keep growing perpetually.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Delegation is a natural process, but it does not always happen naturally and by itself. And it cannot happen at all, unless there is someone to delegate to. The pressure to maintain high earnings in order to satisfy the board of directors, investors or analysts on Wall Street prompts many growing companies to delay adding people, until serious symptoms begin to manifest. The ability to recognize when new positions are needed and to add them in time is essential for continuous growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE JOB OF MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is one other important reason why delegation is difficult for many CEOs, executives and managers. They do not know what they should be doing, if they stop doing what they are doing now. It comes back to the question we have heard so often, &quot;What really is my job, anyway?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fred Smith has answered the question very clearly in the negative sense of defining what the job of a manager is not. At Federal Express&#39;s management course, he tells first line managers:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;If you think that management is moving this piece of paper from one side of the desk to the other, or being a megaphone for upper management, or signing your name for some performance review, you better start looking for a job. Because we&#39;re going to automate that right out of existence. We can&#39;t afford to have a nanny for every 15 people in this company.</span><span class="c6 c8 c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">What you are employed for is to bring your intellectual energy to some sort of business problem.</span><span class="c4 c6 c17">&nbsp;</span><span class="c17 c8">To make the cost of what we do less, or the value of what we do more for the customer. When we put that on the line to people,</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">we go a very long way toward keeping the organization energized.</span><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If pushing paper, being a megaphone or signing a performance review is not management, what is? To answer this we have to distinguish between two types of management: operational management of the existing business and developmental management of corporate growth. Smith is saying that his operational managers cannot afford to be doing mere physical tasks that can be delegated to a lower level or a system. But what about higher level managers in the company?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The real responsibility of higher level management is not operational. It is developmental. The primary responsibilities of the management team are to direct their attention toward the development of each of the five engines of the business in order to release their untapped potentials: i.e. development of people, identification of new opportunities in the market, evaluation of new technologies, examination of innovative financial techniques, and more importantly, accelerated development of the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Review the list of tasks you perform. How many executives, even of multi-billion dollar corporations, really dedicate their time and energy to developing these five engines? If your goal is to grow rapidly and profitably, the job of the CEO and senior executives must evolve to the point where developing the business is their main responsibility, if not their sole occupation. But that is only possible when all levels of the organization develop in unison. Delegation is an important key to that development, but it is not the only key.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">For the next key, we turn to another basic subunit of organization, the act.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ANALYZING ACTIVITIES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Energy expresses in work as movement, as action. The faster and smoother the action, the higher the energy it generates and expresses. The energy and speed of movement on the streets of New York can be quite startling to first time visitors. That is raw, unorganized activity-people moving hurriedly in all directions, bumping into one another, each pushing to further his or her individual goal without regard for the others and without a common plan or direction. Peak performing organizations achieve a similar speed and energy, but without the haste, waste and confusion. They harness the energy and organize the action, so that it flows smoothly, quietly and harmoniously without friction.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The individual act is the basic subunit of corporate functioning. Each step performed by an individual in carrying out a task in fulfillment of a responsibility of his or her job is a mental or physical act. These acts are linked with other acts in a chain to generate activities. Organization is the capacity to carry out several different activities at different times or different places in such a way that they serve a common purpose. Anything that increases the capacity to conduct activities efficiently and effectively increases the power and productivity of the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We began our examination of job positions by asking some fundamental questions about your job to show that jobs are capable of continuous development and that that development in turn enables the organization to grow. Like jobs, activities can be continuously improved too. Each improvement releases fresh energy and makes the organization more effective.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The approval of new drugs for medicinal application is a very laborious and time-consuming process in the U.S.A. and most European countries. The Dutch subsidiary of a huge multinational pharmaceutical company was averaging 32 months to obtain government approval for sale of new drugs in the Netherlands. The company accepted the long period as the inevitable result of government bureaucracy. In the course of reviewing major activities in the company, a consultant examined the drug registration process and came up with a surprising conclusion. He reported that in spite of the slow government procedure, it would still be possible to reduce the registration period from 32 months to 21 months. He argue that in the process of receiving potential new drugs from the company&#39;s overseas headquarters and evaluating them for possible marketing in Holland, the company was carrying out many actions successively, that could be equally well performed simultaneously. He also pointed out that while the government reserved the right to 90 and 120 days response times to submissions by the company, in the past the company had failed to issue reminders to the government, even when responses had been delayed over 150 days. The management of the drug company finally became convinced that the reduction in time was in fact achievable and calculated that by getting new drugs on the market nearly a year earlier, the company would earn additional net profit of more than $500,000 from each new drug it introduced. A week later, the head of the pharmaceutical division happened to meet his Dutch counterpart from Merck &amp; Co. On enquiry, he learned with amazement that Merck&#39;s average registration time was only 16 months and that on two occasions they had done it in six months!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If that is the potential improvement that can be obtained on an activity so dependent on the government, how much greater is the potential in the hundreds of strictly internal activities in your company? The type of activity analysis applied by the pharmaceutical company for an administrative process can be applied to any research or manufacturing process as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Today many manufacturers are analyzing their product development activities in order to reduce the time from initial conception to putting a new product or new model on the market. Honda has cut the development time on new cars from five years to three. AT&amp;T has reduced development time on their phones from two years to one. Hewlett-Packard has cut to less than half the time it takes to bring new printers to the market. Other companies are accelerating the time from receipt of order to delivery of finished products. General Electric has brought down delivery time on its circuit breaker boxes from three weeks to three days. Motorola has cut the time for delivering new electronic pagers from three weeks to two hours.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about some of the important activities in your company or your department. How much scope is there to improve the quality or reduce the time required for completing each activity? What would be the impact of such an improvement on the service to customers, efficiency, revenues and profits? What would be the result on other activities of the company of accelerating performance on just one major activity?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">These achievements are triumphs of organizational innovation. They have been brought about by a minute analysis of every step in these key activities. They involve changes in the way activities are conceived, executed and linked together and in the way responsibilities are allocated to different positions and levels of the organization. But in order to raise performance on any corporate activity to the maximum possible level, a rationalization of individual acts and a reallocation of responsibilities is not enough. A third essential element is required, the third basic subunit of organization, systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SYSTEMS ANALYSIS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are the mechanism which an organization uses to link activities with each other and to link activities with positions. Activities involving thoughts and decisions are linked together through management information systems and manual or computerized decision-making systems, like the ones referred to under the section on delegation. Physical activities are linked together through standard operating procedures, which define a series of physical tasks to be carried out, like the ones Minit International employs for the operation of its service centers, regions and national subsidiaries.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems possess an amazing power of expansion. Systems supported the expansion of Minit International from one service unit in a Brussels department store to thousands of units world-wide. Systems enabled Compaq computers to reach the Fortune 500 list faster than any other corporation in history. Compaq grew from $111 million in 1983, its first year of operation, to $1.2 billion in 1987. At the time it was founded, Compaq put in place systems that would enable it to grow exponentially without slowing down or looking back.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems possess the power to carry out activities much more quickly, precisely and regularly than individuals can perform them on their own. Herein lies their tremendous power to energize an organization. The productivity of an organization is determined by the extent to which routine and recurring physical activities are systematized as standard operating procedures.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are not dead or mechanical devices. They derive their power directly from corporate values like orderliness, punctuality, standardization, coordination, etc. Think for a moment of the last time an important decision or action was unduly delayed in your company. What was the impact on corporate energy? We have seen the morale of an entire company sink to a low ebb, because a performance review system introduced to improve morale was running six months behind schedule. Speed up that process and what is the result. Everyone gets energized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are usually associated with drudgery, bureaucracy and monotonous repetition. But the companies which are the most creative and fun to work in are very often those which have converting systematic functioning into a fine art. The high level of customer service and the genuinely friendly and relaxed manner of Marriott hotel employees are a direct result of the systems the company has in place to make everyone&#39;s job easier. Contrast the experience we described in the palatial Dallas hotel, when we asked room service to serve coffee an hour earlier with this one from the Marriott O&#39;Hare:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">It was the hotel&#39;s fault from beginning to end. We ordered breakfast for 8:15a.m. to be ready for a seminar starting at 8:45. Our breakfasts did not arrive on time and we were getting a little nervous. At 8:20 we called room service and they promised to send them up immediately. At 8:22a.m. there was a knock at the door. As the door opened, a smiling waiter said, &quot;I am extremely sorry your breakfast is late. It is on us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The impact was profound. The waiter was simply carrying out a company standard, which is written on a card in the room. &quot;If your breakfast is late, it&#39;s on us.&quot; Think about what is happening here. In a split second, the customer&#39;s tension and the employee&#39;s anxiety are eliminated by a system. The employee, who probably had nothing to do with the late breakfast in the first place, can maintain his cheerfulness, because he is supported by a system.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Time after time we have found that in companies which have built up basic systems to support smooth-running routine activities, people are more relaxed and cheerful and enjoy their work better. AMRE is a dramatic example. Virtually every recurring activity has been reduced to a system at AMRE. It is a hard hitting, fast growing company where people, like Bud Lane, are really enjoying themselves. &quot;I never had it so good. I&#39;m working twice as hard, but I love it. I go home at night feeling good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems have been the key to AMRE&#39;s non-stop growth. As the company has anticipated its people needs six months down the line, it has always tried to build its systems with plenty of extra capacity to accommodate future growth. Trying to bring your systems up-to-date after the fact is &quot;like trying to build an airplane in the air. We&#39;ve never had that problem. We build it on the ground,&quot; says Ward Richardson, vice president of Management Information Services. The other thing AMRE has done is to keep the systems simple, so that they are easy to understand and easy to operate. Richardson adds, &quot;We keep our systems as simple as we can, so that people can interact and work with the systems. So they don&#39;t learn to hate them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE is not only a fun company to work in. It is a creative one too. &quot;I&#39;ve never been in a functionally freer creative environment that here,&quot; Richardson exclaimed. &quot;The creativity has been tremendous.&quot; That creativity is made possible because the organization at AMRE is continuously evolving. Not only do jobs continuously change. The systems do too. &quot;Systems constantly have to be changed,&quot; says Bud Lane. &quot;Steve (Bedowitz) is constantly saying in staff meetings, Just because you did it this way a year ago, doesn&#39;t mean that it works now. What have you done recently to streamline your systems?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As individual jobs constantly evolve in a growing organization, systems can be constantly improved in their functioning to carry the organization to higher levels. As jobs grow by adding on and shedding specific tasks in an incremental manner, systems grow by continuous refinement and innovation. Even relatively minor improvements can energize a simple activity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Computerization has had a major impact on the growth of P.A.M. Recently the company added a small modification to its computerized dispatch system. It introduced a 13 digit alphanumeric code for each consignment that classified the shipment in terms of one-way or round-trip, the type of equipment required, the pick-up and delivery location, and other factors. The code improves communication between the solicitor who takes the customer&#39;s order and the dispatcher who arranges for a pick-up. It enables dispatchers to more efficiently utilize the equipment at their disposal by easily sorting shipments by the type of equipment needed and the location. It also enables the driver to identify key facts about each shipment at a glance and serve the customer better. The estimated savings from this small innovation could be several hundred thousand dollars a year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are like atoms. They contain tremendous latent energy. The more refined the improvements, the greater the power released. Federal Express recently introduced a peelable bar-coded label, which its couriers use to affix an airway bill number to each parcel, instead of writing out a number by hand at the point of pick-up and the point of delivery. The cumulative savings generated by eliminating 3 seconds from each transaction works out to 542 hours per day or more than $2 million per year!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Even in a company as committed to systems as Federal Express, evolving new and better systems fast enough to sustain maximum rates of growth has been difficult. Says Smith, &quot;The brake on the company&#39;s ability to meet the demand in the market has been systems. Today organization is not just people in boxes. It&#39;s the way you align against business problems. The development of strategic information systems, which is an integral part of that organization, is probably the biggest brake on what we can do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the systems in your company. How effectively do they perform their allotted tasks? What have you done lately to streamline your systems and build them up for rapid growth? The second exercise at the end of this chapter is an analysis of your company&#39;s key systems. The future of your company depends on the constant development of new and improved systems to carry out activities faster, better and more efficiently.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ORGANIZATION: TOO MUCH OF TOO LITTLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization is absolutely essential for the existence and growth of any company. The fast growing companies referred to in this book could never have grown as rapidly and as large as they have, if they had not grown their internal organizations to keep pace with their external expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet we read constantly these days of how large companies are attacking what they perceive as excessive organization by slashing red tape, reducing the number of management layers, and decentralizing decision-making. So much has been written and said on the dangers of bureaucracy and complacency, that even small and mid-side firms which lack the minimum structure needed for survival and growth have developed an aversion to adding new people and more systems. Some entrepreneurial-style managers take such great efforts to prevent the growth of organizational weeds, that the flowers stop growing too. How can you tell whether you need more organization or less?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Does your company suffer from any of these symptoms: inability to respond aggressive to opportunities and changes in the external environment, slow decision-making, poor communication or coordination, declining speed, quality or productivity? If so, the company may have too much organization-or it may have too little! For the symptoms of both are often the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The bureaucratic, over-organized company is very slow to respond to opportunities and changes in the external environment, because senior executives are out of touch with the field and their own front-line operations. Its decision-making is slow, because too many people and steps are involved in getting approvals. Communication and coordination are poor, because the company has become segmented and fragmented into isolated departments and divisions. Speed, productivity and quality decline, because authority is vested in managers who are too far removed from the activities they are responsible for directing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The under-staffed, under-organized company is slow to respond to opportunities and changes in the external environment, because senior management is so preoccupied by fighting fires and maintaining existing operations, that it has no time to think of the future. Its decision-making is slow, because there are too many decisions to make and too few people to make them. Communication and coordination are poor, because either there is not time, no system or no person responsible. Speed, productivity and quality decline, because people and systems are not adequate to handle the volume of work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The symptoms of excessive organization and inadequate organization can be very similar, because in both instances the organization is not suited to the present needs of the company. Any company can assess the suitability of its organization by applying the basic tools discussed above to any problem.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">APPLYING THE BASIC TOOLS OF THE TRADE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What does your company do when something goes wrong? In many companies, the first impulse is to blame somebody. Yet in most cases the real culprit lies elsewhere-a job that is not clearly defined, responsibility that does not match authority, systems that are inadequate, or an activity that needs to be streamlined. In order to properly diagnose the problem, you have to return to fundamentals.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">General Electric&#39;s success in reducing delivery time on its circuit breaker boxes from three weeks to three days dramatically illustrates the power of analyzing organizational problem at their roots. The strategy GE employed involved analyzing and making improvements in all three subunits-the systems, the activities and the positions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">A team of manufacturing, design and marketing experts was assembled to analyze GE&#39;s entire $1 billion circuit breaker business. The team started by recommending a change in structure. It consolidated operations from six manufacturing units into one. It then analyzed the 28,000 parts used in making 40,000 different sizes and shapes of circuit boxes. By standardization, the number of parts was reduced to 1,275. A new computer system was introduced, which automatically programs factory machines when sales people enter new orders. This eliminated an entire activity of referring all new orders to the engineering department. The number of layers of plant management was also reduced to facilitate quick communication and decision-making. In addition, a new structure was created consisting of teams of workers, which were invested with the authority and responsibility previously exercised by managers at a higher level.</span><a id="id.j64no3iojajn"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Fortune reports: &quot;Everything those middle managers used to handle-vacation scheduling, quality, work rules-became the responsibility of 129 workers on the floor, who are divided into teams of 15 to 20. And what do you know. The more responsibility GE gave the workers, the faster problems got solved and decisions made.&quot;</span><span class="c15">23</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">These changes have enabled the company to increase productivity by 20%, reduce costs by 30%, and bring down the backlog of orders from two months to two days.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the problems and constraints facing your company. How many of them can be resolved by restructuring jobs, refining systems or streamlining activities? How can you grow your business and double profits by applying these basic tools of organization?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE REAL POWER OF ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Thus far we have been looking at the basic subunits of organization and the way they fit together and interact to accomplish the company&#39;s work. We have also looked at some of the ways in which these subunits develop and how that development improves the functioning of the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">But the true source of organization&#39;s energy and creativity does not lie within any of these basic subunits. They are just the building blocks. The real energy of organization is generated by the relationships created between the subunits. The real creativity of organization lies in its ability to link these subunits-people, activities, systems, materials and time-together in ever new, more complex, more effective combinations.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The real power of organization arises from its capacity for coordination and integration of people, activities and systems</span><span class="c3">. Coordination and integration are two of the advanced tools of organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We said earlier that the development of jobs increases the level of integration in the organization by linking higher and lower levels closely together, so they act as a single whole and shifting actions from higher to lower levels. The development of systems increases the level of coordination in the organization by linking separate activities and separate systems together as part of a greater unified whole.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The power of coordination and integration can be most dramatically illustrated by their absence. Departments and divisions isolate themselves into duchies or mini-empires as they did at Chrysler before Iacocca arrived. When Iacocca joined Chrysler, the company had all the pieces in place, but they were not working together with one another. Production was not speaking with engineering, engineering was not listening to what sales tried to tell them the customers wanted. Management and workers were completely at odds. Talented middle managers were stifled by a top heavy bureaucracy of executives out of touch with the front lines. As a result in spite of its enormous resources and technological competence, the entire company-a $12 billion operation-came to the brink of bankruptcy. Iacocca broke down the barriers that divided divisions, departments and levels of the organization from one another, opened up communication, streamlined and accelerated new model development activity, and put in the systems needed for effective coordination and control of the giant company. These measures not only saved Chrysler and returned it to profitability. They also provided it with the organization it needed to more than double in size over the next five years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Coordination of activities can generate a powerful impetus for growth. East Asiatic Company is one of the last of the giant trading houses of Europe. The company was founded in 1871 by a Danish merchant seaman who bought a shipload of teakwood lumber in the Kingdom of Siam and sold it in Europe. Throughout the decades the company diversified into many different fields, but still maintained its timber business. In the early 1980s EAC&#39;s timber operations consisted of 26 activities centers around the world buying, selling, warehousing and distributing lumber. Not infrequently, these highly decentralized timber centers ended up competing against one another for the purchase of timber from a supplier or sales to a customer. In 1983 the company made some changes to improve coordination and integration of its worldwide timber activities. It reorganized the timber division geographically and introduced new systems to closely coordinate the activities of each center with the other centers. As a direct result of improved coordination, profits of the division, which had been flat throughout the early 1980s, grew by 30% a year for three years in a row.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In our survey of U.S. companies, there was a significant difference in the level of coordination reported by the most successful and the least successful companies. The larger and more profitable companies reported closer coordination in all areas: between sales and marketing, marketing and research, research and production, and production and sales.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The power of coordination and integration can be demonstrated at any level and in any part of an organization. Bang &amp; Olufsen operates three machine shops at its production facility on the Jutland peninsula of Denmark. Until recently the shops were each headed by a manager who reported independently to the vice-president. In early 1987 a new position, director of machine shops, was created to coordinate activities of the three departments. Within the first six months, productivity of the three shops increased by 25%. Per Kysgaard, the director, explained: &quot;We really did not do anything much. We just talked about improving coordination between the shops. The response has been tremendous.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">COMPREHENSIVE COORDINATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization has been a key factor in the phenomenal nine-fold growth of Linear Technology over the last five years. The company has a lean, simple structure with clear functional areas and clear lines of authority. When the work goes well and when there are problems, everyone knows who is responsible.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But the real power of Linear&#39;s organization arises from its commitment to the value of coordination in virtually every one of the company&#39;s departments, activities and systems. In Chapter Two we described how Linear fosters close coordination between its chip designers, production engineers, sales force and customers. Responsibility for that coordination is built right into the job description of the design engineer. &quot;The designer knows his job is more than design,&quot; says Robert Dobkin, vice president of Engineering, who encourages his designers to get out and talk with customers-which he refers to as &quot;sending out our crown jewels&quot;-and to be actively involved in all areas of production where problems arise. It is the designers&#39; responsibility to go out with the sales force to learn what customers need, to move with the chips he designs right through the production process and work closely with production engineers to iron out any production problems, and to directly deal with customers who encounter problems in utilizing the chips in their products. Many companies have problems getting their design engineers to design products that are producible. Very often the problem is attitude...&quot;a natural antipathy between designers and manufacturing&quot; as one engineer put it. That is not a problem at Linear. &quot;Our design engineers recognize the importance of the manufacturing component,&quot; says Brian Hollins, vice president of Operations. &quot;They are very good at following the product through the production process.&quot; In this way the designers are not sheltered from quality and reliability problems.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Coordination does not stop there. Linear has created an entire cadre of field application engineers, FAEs, to accompany the sales people on visits to customers to improve the linkage between design, production and sales. There is also an FAE Coordinator, whose responsibility it is to report back opportunities and problems from the market to the designers. The coordinator&#39;s reports go to engineering, marketing and senior management. In order to generate quick responses to problems, the coordinator is authorized to directly interface with people in all departments without going through the respective vice presidents.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The same attitude and effort can be seen in other areas. Every week the company conducts a production control meeting to ensure close coordination between design, production, quality control, sales, and finance. &quot;If this meeting didn&#39;t take place, you could plot the decline of the company on a graph,&quot; says CEO Robert Swanson. The meeting is run by the production control manager, PCM, who reports to the vice president of finance rather than to the head of production. This results in better coordination between inventory management and cost control and gives the PCM greater freedom to press for responsiveness from the production team.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The production control meeting is also a good example of how Linear fosters the value of integration. The meeting is attended by 25 top managers including the CEO and senior executives. It gives top management direct access to information from middle management. It also gives middle management direct access to the highest level of decision-making, which is one of the reasons for the company&#39;s great responsiveness to new needs and new situations.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE ULTIMATE SECRET</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Freedom is the essential condition for creativity. The individual grows only in freedom, but organization is based on the principle of order and stability. The ultimate measure of an organization is its ability to give people freedom without losing its cohesiveness and effectiveness.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The proper balance of self-discipline and freedom provides the stability and creativity needed for an endless expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Linear has developed its own formula for freedom and discipline. It has raised the value of freedom to a high level in some areas. It gives a remarkable latitude of freedom to its designers to decide what type of products they want to develop. &quot;Freedom to design what you will is the key,&quot; says design director Tom Redfern. Yet in other areas it is run strictly according to the book, with no latitude for deviation. &quot;I run a two-headed monster,&quot; says Swanson. &quot;The design guys have a lot of freedom, because they need it. The rest of the company runs with an iron fist.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Freedom and discipline are not mutually exclusive. Rather they make each other possible. Freedom without discipline is chaos. Discipline without freedom is tyranny.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The ultimate secret is to arrive at a delicate balance between the two. The company should provide freedom for entrepreneurial energies and newly emerging ideas and initiatives to sprout and develop, unencumbered by excessive organizational constraint. At the same time, it should fully organize all established areas, systematize every routine and recurring operation, so that those activities can proceed smoothly and effortlessly, leaving the best minds and the greatest energy free for creativity and innovation.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Yet Linear still has challenges to meet to keep its organization dynamic and growing. Swanson is still striving for that delicate balance between freedom and discipline. &quot;Now I&#39;m cracking down on the design group a little. The trick is that if I get them too organized, I&#39;ll destroy some of the free spirit, the creativity.&quot; Swanson is a very hands-on CEO. He is the driving force for growth, the source of the energy that propels the company forward. He is also still searching for a means to create engines of growth at the next level, so that the company can continue to expand rapidly, without everything relying on him. &quot;There is an organizational challenge awaiting me here in the future. That is, how to create an organization where there is a focus of energy on each key area of the business. It can&#39;t all come from me any more.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Swanson has succeeded in implementing corporate values, like coordination, integration and freedom at a high level, that are critical for the continuous growth of an organization. But he has not yet been able to institutionalize that implementation to the extent that it becomes a self-generating and self-perpetuating source of energy for non-stop growth. The challenges he faces are the challenges that confront every company that wants to create a living organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CREATING A LIVING ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">An organization becomes creative when its capacities are fully utilized and it functions at peak levels. Otherwise it degenerates, its components parts operating in isolation from each other and ceases to be an organization. It becomes a bureaucracy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">The secret to keeping an organization alive and youthful is to keep it operating at its maximum capacity and to keep increasing that capacity by constantly upgrading the quality of its subunits and the coordination and integration between them.</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Then the organization flowers into a living organism with its own energy and dynamism for growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization is most alive when its every act is fresh and vibrant with energy. Usually in a company each fresh, energizing experience is counter-balanced by thousands of routine acts which dull our sensibilities and drain our energies. Yet it need not be so. It is possible for companies to structure and carry out work in such a way that every activity, every job, every individual act becomes a refreshing and energizing experience for the individual, and a stimulus for the further growth of the company. Chapter Fourteen presents practical strategies to energize individual acts and thereby energize the corporation as a whole.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">STRATEGIES TO ENERGIZE YOUR ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">1. Establish clear job descriptions for every position and create a system whereby the responsibilities and authority of each position are clear to other people in the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">2. Analyze the jobs of executives, managers and supervisors to identify tasks that can be delegated to lower levels and the conditions necessary to make that delegation effective.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">3. Conduct an analysis of major activities in the company such as selling, advertising, order taking, invoicing, product development, project management, purchasing, maintenance, customer service, dispatch, etc. to identify ways to increase the speed, reduce the cost, eliminate unnecessary steps and improve the quality of these activities. Afterwards extend the analysis to minor activities as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">4. Assess the effectiveness of important systems in the company in terms of their speed, manpower requirements, quality of work and cost of operation.

In that sense this entire book is about ways to energize the component market for the growth of your company. In Chapter Six, we looked at the market in its widest sense as co-terminus with society. Every change in society creates new needs and new markets for companies that are quick to perceive their significance and to seize the opportunity. New technologies, new life styles, new laws and political configurations, and new types of organization are social developments with major impact on market opportunities. Companies like Liz Claiborne, Reebok, AMRE, Expeditors International, Gartner Group, P.A.M. and Mesa perceived such changes and converted them into opportunities for rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In other chapters we have looked at companies which have grown their markets by implementing values like customer service, quality, and on-time delivery. SAS and Linear Technology are dramatic examples of the power of value implementation to attract customers. These two approaches to the market, one focussed on external changes and the other on internal developments, are important elements of a comprehensive approach to the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our goal is to convert each of the five components of your business into an engine for rapid growth. Many people and companies consider market the most important of the five, yet the one that is least under our control. There is an almost superstitious reverence for the munificent market, which is the provider of all bounty, and an equally superstitious fear of the fickle or despotic market, which takes away as quickly as it gives. &quot;After all,&quot; they argue, &quot;businesses are created to meet the demands of the market and to thrive on it. When the market falls, there is not much you can do but hang on and pray for a speedy recovery.&quot; On the other hand, today there are many large successful companies that seem to dominate the market and actually command it to do their bidding. They boast, &quot;We create the market. We decide what the customer will have. We provide it and the customer buys.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Both of these views of the market express a partial truth. The market creates businesses and business creates markets. The market is at once something vast and external to a company and at the same time something with which every company is in close and intimate contact. It can be cold and aloof. It can also be warm and embracing. But the relationship is not as one-sided as it may seem. The market is not just an enchanting temptress that leads us along and shares its charms and riches for awhile, before looking elsewhere for its pleasure. It can also be an enchanted lover, true to the core, which seeks after us passionately and clings with everlasting devotion. In this chapter we explore strategies to convert the market into an eternal partner and an engine for endless expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">WHAT IS YOUR MARKET?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The market exists at three different levels. Companies relate to the market in three different ways. At the first level, the market consists of a finite number of recognized needs, and companies compete to meet those needs. There is a strong demand for computers, so we make them. There is a widespread demand for fast and convenient food service, so we provide it. This is the basis of niche marketing. Study the existing market and find a segment or subsegment where your company can effectively compete. Niche marketing is effective, because it enables a company to focus on what it does best. But the niche approach is also limited. It starts and ends with the existing market and tries to maximize gains within the present field. If your company approaches the market from this point of view, its growth is confined to the already established needs of the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At the second level, the market consists of needs which exist, but are unrecognized by society and companies, and therefore are unmet. Companies grow by recognizing those unfulfilled needs, creating a general awareness of them and then meeting them. This is what Fred Smith did when he founded Federal Express. He recognized the latent demand for overnight parcel delivery, generated public awareness of the importance of that need, and established a company to meet it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Vipont Pharmaceuticals has done something similar. It recognized an unmet need in an increasingly health conscious population and created a product to meet that need. Toothpaste is a $1.2 billion a year commodity business, in which dozens of giant suppliers compete with one another for valuable shelf space in supermarkets and drug stores. What chance would a tiny startup toothpaste company have against Goliaths like Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate? Vipont realized it was fighting against heavy odds in 1981 when it introduced a new toothpaste containing sanguinaria, a natural medicinal compound from the bloodroot plant, which has been proven effective in preventing the formation of oral plaque, a major cause of gum disease that afflicts some 40 million Americans.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Vipont started, there was very little awareness of the dangers of plaque and no manifest demand for an anti-plaque toothpaste and mouthwash, especially at twice the price of regular brands. Vipont did not enter an existing market at all. It created a new one. Instead of trying to compete on national television against the majors, Vipont chose another strategy. It went directly to dentists and oral hygienists-the ones who knew all about plaque and its dangers-to educate them about the virtues of a sanguinaria-based toothpaste and mouthwash. The strategy worked. The professionals recognized the value of the product and began recommending it to their patients. The awareness they created gave birth to a new market for anti-plaque toothpaste and mouthwash. Vipont has risen on the crest of that emerging market from sales of $12,000 in 1981 to $33.5 million in 1988 and is still growing at 30% a year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">You do not have to be an original thinker or visionary to identify unmet needs. You need an open, curious mind and careful observation. What are the unrecognized needs in your industry? What new dimension or incremental improvement can you add to an existing product or service that will meet a latent need of society or your customers and create a new market that does not now exist?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Not every company can create a new product or a new market. But the third level of market is open to all.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">There is in every industry a gap between what the market actually needs or wants and what companies perceive it wants. That gap represents fertile untapped ground for any company that can become more conscious of the market&#39;s real wants.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Even as great a marketing company as Coca-Cola failed to rightly perceive the wants of its customer, when it introduced the new Coke in the mid-1980s. The American automobile industry has become notorious for its blatant inability or unwillingness to really understand what the market wants and to provide it. The gap created by that failure served as an open invitation for invasion by European carmakers in the 1960s and the Japanese in the 1980s.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">How do you become conscious of something of which you are unconscious? One simple method is to ask! That is what Ford Motors did about five years ago when it finally realized that the old way of doing business in a comfortable shared monopoly industry was dead. When Ford launched it project to develop the Taurus, it identified and adapted some of the best features found on competitors&#39; cars. Then it did the unthinkable. For the first time, Ford asked customers detailed questions about what they wanted. The company compiled a list of 1,401 customer wants, including apparently insignificant details such as lettering under the hood to help the non-mechanically minded distinguish the radiator from the battery and to know where to put in the oil! More than 700 of these ideas were incorporated in the Taurus and Sable models. Behold the response. Ford sold about half a million of the new models in the very first year.</span><a id="id.9qtzbs8p821t"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">The Taurus went on to become one of the best selling cars in the U.S. for three years in succession.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Car and Driver</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">called it &quot;the most agile and capable sedan Detroit has ever produced.&quot;</span><span class="c15">24</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Closing the gap between what the market wants and what we think it wants is an exercise in objectivity and humility. For many companies, this one strategy is enough to double sales. Small improvements can make a big difference. When is the last time you really and systematically asked your customers about their preferences? If it was not today or yesterday, perhaps you should ask again.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Asking for the customer&#39;s preferences opens up new avenues for growth, but by itself it is a partial approach. Many companies have come to understand a general truth of human nature. The individual is not fully conscious of what he or she wants or likes or why. The same is true of the market. </span><span class="c4">The market is conscious only at the minimum level of its needs.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">If a company offers a new product or an improved service, the market knows whether it likes it or not. It can even make suggestions for minor improvements, but rarely more than that. This is what Federal Express has learned asking customers&#39; about their needs. Carole Presley, senior vice president of Marketing, says, &quot;People don&#39;t have a clue of what to ask for beyond what they currently are getting. They want what they are currently getting to work precisely 100% of the time. The customer can&#39;t help you identify new opportunities.&quot; That does not mean that preferences do not exist, it only means they are not conscious.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If the customers can not tell you their preferences, then how to you find out? That requires a new attitude and an effort to identity with the customer. C.E. Woolman, founder of Delta Airlines, described the attitude as &quot;putting yourself on the other side of the counter and looking at things from the customer&#39;s point of view.&quot; The effort required is one of careful observation, perception, and thoughtfulness.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The level at which your company relates to the market determines the scope for its expansion. Relating to unfulfilled needs and unmet preferences opens up endless opportunities for growth in any industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">WHO IS YOUR CUSTOMER?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As companies relate to the market at three different levels, they also view the customer from four different perspectives. The wider and deeper the view, the greater is the market that opens. First and most commonly, companies relate to the customer from the point of view of the product. I have a product to sell. Anyone who buys it is my customer. Companies with this view have a very limited idea of who their customers are, what their needs are or how to attract more of them. They rely on the product to do that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The second view is more expansive. Look at the customer as a member of society. Identify the social characteristics of the customer and think of ways to meet the needs of specific social groups. Julius Rosenwald followed this approach when he introduced Sear&#39;s famed money-back guarantee at the turn of the century. Sears was selling to rural farmers, who were highly suspicious of urban merchants, especially mail-order merchants! Understanding the need of that social group, Rosenwald introduced the money-back offer to assure them of quality and complete satisfaction. Henry Ford did the same thing when he built a low-priced car for the working class man. He understood the urge of the working class to live the American dream of owning a car. So he designed and built the Model T at less than half the price of existing models and revolutionize the automotive industry. When Liz Claiborne introduced a line of garments specially designed for working women, the company was looking at the customer as a member of a social group with distinct characteristics. When Gideon Gartner packaged information on the computer industry specifically for decision-making computer users, he was looking at a social subset too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Looking at the customer as a member of society with distinct characteristics and specific needs has enabled these companies to vastly expand the market for their products and services, in some cases to a size greater than the entire original industry it started in.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The third view of the customer opens even greater vistas. Look at the customer simply as an individual. Recognize the needs and preferences that any individual would have and cater to them. Apple Computers thought from the individual&#39;s point of view when they created the user-friendly Macintosh computer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It did not take a genius to realize that companies which pay high prices to get valuable documents delivered overnight would like to have access to up-to-the-minute information regarding the location and status of their parcels-but it did take a company with an open mind, thinking about what other people think. Federal Express realized that getting the parcel there quickly was really only half of what the customer wanted. In many cases the customer also wanted to know that the parcel had arrived, and if not, when it would. In practice, the company discovered that immediate information about the parcel was even more important to many customers than on-time delivery itself.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The fourth and most powerful view is to relate to the customer, not merely as an individual who shares much in common with everyone else, but as a unique individual who has unique needs, preferences and identity. Hotel customers do appreciate the chocolate on the pillow or the newspaper under the door-everyone likes chocolate-even when they know that the same treatment is given to every other customer as well. But nothing evokes such a powerful response as when the customer realizes that the company relates to him or her as a unique individual. The effort a company makes to custom-tailor a product or service to meet a specific need, to solve problems to the customer&#39;s total satisfaction, or just to recognize the customer by name makes a lasting impression.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Who are your customers? How well do you know them? How deeply do you cater to the specific needs and characteristics which distinguish them from others? What more can you do to differentiate your products or services, so that they more closely meet your customers&#39; social or individual characteristics?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">MAKING THE MARKET RESPOND</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When a company appeals very deeply and powerfully to the conscious or unconscious need of the market, the market rushes toward it and literally drives its growth. It is possible for any company to make the market respond with that intensity by what the company does within itself, without going out to seek the market at all.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The market is attracted to a company by the intensity and quality of the work it does. Virtually every strategy described in this book to release and utilize corporate energies more effectively, to raise the quality of work by implementing values, and to energize and balance the five components can directly or indirectly attract the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The following nine strategies can be used to energize the market for your company and bring it to your door.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hard Work</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How do you feel when you enter a store where the employees are too preoccupied talking among themselves to attend to your needs or when the bell man at a luxury hotel sees you walking in with heavy luggage and leisurely gets up from his chair and strolls over to greet you? Contrast this with your feeling when you enter a company where people are alert, active, brisk and busily engaged in work. Even if you are kept waiting, the energy and activity itself is attractive. Hard work attracts the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Organized Work can energize the market</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When work is well-organized, streamlined and smooth running, it attracts the market even more. Customers who come in contact feel a sense of competence and confidence that brings them back. Any improvement in the functioning of your organization can have a direct or indirect impact on the market. Organization influences quality, friendliness, speed of response, accuracy, reliability, orderliness...literally everything your company does.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization even helps you know your customers better. Knowing exactly who your customers are enables your company to utilize the most effective means for reaching them. AMRE has a sophisticated customer tracking system that enables it to track every response to its TV advertisements and direct mail to determine precisely which state or zip code generates the highest rates of response and the highest closing ratios. All ad responses come in through postage paid return cards or over WATS lines to a centralized point where the customer is qualified by well-trained phone operators and appointments are made for sales people in offices around the country. This eliminates the necessity for sales people to identify their own leads and enables them to concentrate on making sales. AMRE&#39;s sales force averages a closing rate of nearly 20% on average sales over $6,000.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perfect Work</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Perfect work means work that is done by happy employees in a harmonious and flawless manner by implementing corporate values to a high degree. Companies that achieve this level of performance are irresistibly attractive to customers. People enjoy making contact with the company and seek every opportunity to come back.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Raising performance on any value can energize the market.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">SAS did it with speed and customer service. Ford did it with quality. Merck has done it with credibility. Northwestern Mutual has done it through a commitment to teamwork and customer service. AMRE did it with systematic functioning and development of its people. Any value can evoke an intensely positive response from the customer. P.A.M. has discovered what McDonald&#39;s has known for decades. Even a simple value like cleanliness can have a tremendous impact. P.A.M. prides itself on maintaining its trucks in mint condition. Frequently existing and would-be customers comment on how impressed they are by the sparkling cleanliness of the equipment. Cleanliness attracts too. If you do not believe that, watch your own reaction the next time you go into a restaurant that is not clean.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People can energize the market</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Knowledgeable, well-trained, cheerful people with pleasant, positive attitudes toward the customer can make a world of difference. You cannot order people to be cheerful. If you want your people to please your customers, make sure your people are happy. Carole Presley of Federal Express explains: &quot;Every time our customers make a phone call to us they notice exactly what the agent&#39;s tone of voice is and whether that agent went to the full extent to answer the question or resolve the issue.&quot; In fact, Federal Express has found that the attitude and behavior of their front-line employees is rated by customers as the real reason why they prefer the company over its competitors-not the fact that it has a higher on-time delivery rate. &quot;Every time we ask the customer to evaluate the company, they always rate our couriers number one, our telephone agents number two, and our customer service agents in the field as number three. These are the top rated attributes. They are rated much higher than on-time delivery.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Capital can energize the market</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Managing finance properly can enable a company to expand its market or create new markets. By maintaining itself as the low-cost airline on commuter runs, Mesa has been able to not only compete effectively, but to actually create new markets in some cases. Federal Express also found that by improving operational efficiencies, it was able to reduce costs and prices by 30% over the last ten years. Lower price dramatically expanded the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Technology can energize the market</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many technologies can be adapted to improve the product or the quality of service to customers and evoke a response from the market. When Federal Express installed DADS computer terminals in every truck and gave a supertracker hand-held terminal to every courier, it really energized people. The couriers, who had felt they were at the bottom of the totem pole, were suddenly at the leading edge of technology. Their sense of pride and motivation increased dramatically. Customers also evinced great curiosity about the new technology too. So the couriers were trained how to make a brief presentation to interested customers about the supertracker and given small brochures they could leave with the customer. What technology from other industries could your company adapt to give it a leading edge in service to your customers or product quality?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Extend the application of your product or service to one new area</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As Vipont extended the use of toothpaste for treating plaque, the use of every product and service can be extended to serve new purposes. Perrier converted mineral water into a popular social drink. The use of aspirin has been extended from treating headaches to heart ailments. How can you extend the use of your existing products and services to serve new purposes or meet new needs?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Improve the quality and accuracy of information to the customer</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Merck has done it through its commitment to the value of credibility with the customer. Listen Up did it through a computerized tracking system for orders in the service department. Whatever the means, providing customers with information they can confidently rely on is a real energizer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relate to the customer as a unique individual</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All that we have said about the power of giving attention to people within the company applies in equal measure to the customer. Nothing makes people respond more than genuine interest and personal attention. Take sincere interest in your customers for their own sake-and not merely because they are customers-and they will seek excuses to relate to your company for the sheer joy of the attention they receive.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ATTENTION TO THE CUSTOMER</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Children respond to attention, but many children are deprived of it. The same is true of husbands, wives, friends, employees and shareholders. It is also true of customers. Nothing attracts customer like personal attention given to them in the form of pleasant, courteous, high quality service. The phone answered on the first ring with a warm, cheerful voice is a pure delight to the customer. The thank you note, the phone call &quot;just to see how you are doing&quot;, the sympathetic listening to a problem, the order promptly and properly dispatched, the literature thoughtfully conceived to answer the customers&#39; real questions-rather than raising new ones!-the letter telling the customer the products on back-order and when we expect to supply them-these are just a few of the small ways in which companies can give attention to their customers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Two things are essential in order to give that attention. First, management and every employee must fully understand and believe that it is good to do so and feel enthusiastic about pleasing the customer. If it is done out of a genuine desire to help and make happy, it is most powerful. All negative attitudes-e.g. the customer is unreasonable, the customer is foolish, the customer is ripping us off-must be tempered by a genuine desire to please.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Second, the company and all its people must have sufficient energy to give that attention. As the child&#39;s inexhaustible demands for attention can exhaust the most energetic parent, the needs of the customer are endless. Therefore, the effort requires an enormous energy, which the company must be able to release from its people and harness effectively without waste. People must be enthused and continuously learning new skills, so that their energies are constantly overflowing. Systems must be fine-tuned and smooth-running, so that all available energy is properly utilized for service. Attention is given though prompt service, which requires an alert, highly efficient organization. It is conveyed through pleasant service, which is possible when people within the company are naturally happy in their work and not under stress. Attention is given through personalized service to the customer. Personalized service can be given to all customers only when impersonal systems are employed to manage routine work down to the last detail. The systems must be developed enough to smoothly handle even heavy bursts of activity and yet flexible enough to adapt to unusual, individual customer demands.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When we refer to the customer, we think of individuals. When we refer to the market, we usually think of an impersonal capacity to buy. But by market, we mean the sum of all actual and potential individual customers in the society. Giving attention to the market means to be genuinely interested in the needs, requirements, ways of life, tastes and levels of appreciation of people in the society. This effort has several dimensions.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There should be a full knowledge of the needs of present customers and the way your products or services are used by them. This knowledge comes from being in constant and close touch with buyers, dealers and actual users. There has to be an awareness of how the ultimate customers actually live or work and how they actually use the products or services as part of that living and working. The company must be constantly thinking about the customers&#39; convenience and finding new ways to serve it. There should also be a full knowledge of the future needs of the customer, new ways in which the products can be used to meet new needs or to raise the level of comfort, convenience, productivity, etc. This requires an analytical study of the customer to discover what might bring greater satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In other words, for a company to energize the market it must be continuously striving to know, understand, serve, please and anticipate the needs of its customers, while at the same time constantly fostering the growth and fulfillment of its own employees to release their enthusiastic energies and perfecting the systems needed for delivering attention to the customer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">YOU ARE BEING WATCHED</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Make no mystery about it. Every company is being watched all the time. Just as we remember exactly how we were treated or mistreated when we went into that restaurant four years ago, just as we can recall exactly how we felt when our new car had to go back for servicing the day after we bought it, just as we can fondly recollect the patience and sympathy unexpectedly shown by a customer service representative after our warrantee had expired, in just the same way every customer remembers or does not remember your company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every company is being talked about too. Both the good experiences and the bad are eagerly shared with family, friends and co-workers. Word-of-mouth is as powerful an advertisement today, as it was in the centuries before TV and radio.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Customers perceive differences. Those differences do not have to be very great in order to make a great deal of difference in our market-just great enough to distinguish us one way or the other from our competitors.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Every time we make a purchase or chose a company, we select on the basis of conscious or unconscious preferences that are often minutely small. Therefore, even a small effort, a small improvement in the product, the service or any other facet of our operations can have a disproportionately positive impact on our business. The same is also true of a small error or failing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">That is why focusing on corporate values is so powerful. Values raise the quality of our performance by significant increments, which become directly visible or indirectly perceptible to the market, even when they are implemented in the depths of the company away from the public eye.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PROFIT PLANNING</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">1.

We see all around us examples of companies that have exploded upon the scene and rocketed into prominence on the basis of a new technology or a new product. But that is to view this component in a narrow sense as the technology of a product or an industrial process. Whereas the component technology is equally applicable to a trucking company or an air freight forwarder.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In its essence, technology is the know-how that enables a company to produce and distribute a product or provide a service to the market. It includes the equipment companies employ for sales, design, production, storage, delivery, accounting, training, measurement, etc. It includes the knowledge, know-how and skills they employ for all these activities as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Each of the five components can be energized in several different ways. In this chapter, we explore two basic strategies for energizing technology: implementing values and integrating technology more closely with the other four components.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The values most directly related to technology are innovation and creativity, quality, safety and maintenance of equipment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are three levels of technology-productive, innovative and creative. Productive technology is any technology which has a practical utility. By innovative technology, we mean technology which has been improved to add greater value, function, economy or quality. Creative technology contains an original element. It is not just improved, it is something new. Technological creativity can be achieved by combining or relating technology to the other four components in new ways. These are some basic principles for identifying potential areas of technological innovation and creativity:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Add one new dimension to the value of the product</span><span class="c1 c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1960 there were more than thirty manufacturers of radios, TVs and hi-fi equipment in Denmark. Today there is only Bang &amp; Olufsen. The others have been swept away by the rise of the giant electronics corporations in Japan and in Europe, which produce in such huge volumes that smaller manufacturers cannot compete. Bang &amp; Olufsen not only survived. It has grown nearly fifty fold in 26 years by adding a totally new dimension to home electronics products-beauty-by combining acoustical quality with elegant design. The company has succeeded so well that its products are displayed in the Museum of Modern Art.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A change in any aspect of the product or service can add a new dimension to its value or convenience. Minit International introduced shoe repairing to prestige department stores and train stations throughout Europe to make the service more accessible. California wine is now being sold to Europe in milk containers in order to reduce the costs of transportation. What new dimension can you add to the products or services you offer, to the way they are packaged or the places they are available?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Integrate new and old technology</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are so many possible technological innovations of which we are unconscious that even without the advent of any new technologies, it is possible to improve virtually any product. Detroit is putting new technology in its cars-the on-board computer-and under them-stainless steel mufflers and coatings to prevent rust. Chrysler has added luxury and convenience with an old technology by installing a small motor to close the trunk in some models. It has become fashionable to put digital clocks on almost everything. What new or old technology can you add to enhance the value of your product or service?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look at technology from the market&#39;s point of view</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Take a conscious effort to identify ways in which your products or services could be made to better serve the needs of the market. Ford and Bang &amp; Olufsen have done this. Merck &amp; Co took this approach in the 1950s, when it gets its research scientists talking directly to marketing people at a very early stage in the research process, so that the direction of scientific enquiry could be more closely tuned to the real needs of patients. This approach enabled Merck to develop drugs to meet previously untreated conditions and drugs suitable for treating patients who could not benefit from existing medicines. It also was a principle reason for the rise of Merck from fifth to first in the U.S. drug industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Create or innovate technology to meet psychological needs</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Apple&#39;s user-friendly Macintosh is a computer which people really enjoy working on-some would even say &quot;love&quot; working on. Studies have shown that the average Mac user spends much more time on the computer than the users of other brands. It is a technology that has psychological appeal-fun. Providing enjoyment or security or educational value to a technology enhances its value.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Look for innovations that reduce cost</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express searches high and low for every possible means to bring down the cost of transporting parcels. It even looked at the way its planes were built and decided it could improve that too. The planes the company uses were originally designed for carrying passengers, not containers of packages. The length of the plane&#39;s body is sufficient to hold 11 standard containers of freight with some room left over. Federal Express found that by modifying the internal frame it could fit an extra container on each flight. This resulted in additional capacity equivalent to the purchase of thirteen new aircraft for a nominal cost, saving the company over a hundred million dollars on equipment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">QUALITY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quality applies to everything-product, service, production technology, showroom displays, packaging, accounting, etc. Regardless of where this value is applied, quality has the power to improve morale, reduce costs and minimize the necessity of re-doing work. Effective implementation of quality involves the five stages outlined earlier in this book-a firm commitment, setting clear and quantifiable standards, assigning responsibility, putting in the right systems to achieve and monitor performance, and training for the right skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">America&#39;s basic manufacturing industries have been under enormous pressure over the past decade to improve quality in everything they do. The</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;commitment</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">to quality is no longer a matter of choice. It is a pressing necessity. Larger customers are insisting on better quality from all their suppliers. In many industries customers are not waiting for vendors to raise their quality</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">standards</span><span class="c3">. The customers are imposing their own. The companies most committed to quality have two sets of standards, the one imposed by the customer and the one they impose on themselves, which is significantly higher.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the olden days quality control departments and inspectors were responsible for quality and empowered to stop production lines and reject products below standard. Today the structure for quality has changed. Everyone has a responsibility for quality. Machine operators are being given the responsibility to monitor their work and the authority to send back substandard parts that come to them. Systems such as statistical process control are being used to provide immediate feedback on quality deviations as they come off the machine. Training is being given to managers, supervisors, operators and workers to improve awareness and skills for quality. Wherever such a comprehensive approach to quality improvement is introduced, the results are impressive.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The experience of Sectional Tool and Die of Ohio is typical. John Babbitt, the founder, launched a major quality program last year. He hired a quality manager who reported directly to the CEO, developed a detailed quality manual, introduced statistical process control systems, and did extensive training. Instead of giving all authority to the quality control inspectors, machine operators were made responsible for monitoring the quality of parts they produced and they were given the systems needed to do so. This really got people involved in finding ways to improve quality. The effort had a dramatic impact on his people and his profitability. Energy, motivation and productivity went way up. The scrap rate fell from 5% to 1%, which added $250,000 to the company&#39;s bottom line on sales of $6 million.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Quality has no end and no limit. Think about quality in your company. What more can you do to improve it?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PUTTING TECHNOLOGY IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Technology is so powerful, that those who are deeply involved with it sometimes forget that in business it cannot function by itself. The full productive and creative power of technology becomes available only when it is kept in proper balance with the other four components.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Vipont Pharmaceuticals was established back in 1968 as a research company to develop products based on sanguinaria. During its first 13 years in business, it never sold a product. By the time Larry Frederick became CEO in 1981, the company had spent the $4 million invested in it over the years and had a negative net worth of $500,000. About the only thing the company had left was a very good product and a great technological potential. The product was the toothpaste. The potential was a technology for using sanguinaria to treat gum disease, which the company felt could help Vipont become a $500 million company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order to bring the toothpaste to market and create the financial and organizational basis for developing the new technology, Frederick and his team had to build up the other four components of the company. They resorted to some creative financial techniques to raise additional capital. They recruited talented and experienced people to head up marketing, sales, and research positions. They put in sophisticated systems for planning, budgeting, financial control and tracking customers. The company which had been treading water for thirteen years suddenly started growing rapidly. Its ability to generate increasing sales and profits over the last few years has also enabled it to invest the funds needed to accelerate development of its technology for gum disease.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Vipont&#39;s growth illustrates how dependent technology is on the other components for its full development and flowering. Larry Holt, vice president of Finance, agrees. &quot;All five components were important.&quot; Until the other four components were suitably developed, the potentials of its technology could not be exploited. The full creative potentials of technology can be tapped by exploring the linkages between this component and the other four.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">MATCHING TECHNOLOGY WITH MARKET</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of the reasons Mesa Airlines has been able to survive the heavy competition from other commuter and regional airlines has been its knack for properly matching its equipment with the needs of the market. Some other new airlines rushed to buy big, fancy Boeing aircraft and then lost heavily flying the highly competitive, larger commercial market routes in order to fill all the seats on the bigger planes. Mesa followed a different strategy. It decided to fly only the lower volume commuter routes, where it could maintain a cost advantage and bought smaller 19 and 13 seat aircraft to suit its strategy. CEO Larry Risley explains, &quot;The thing that has propelled our growth has been the ability to recognize the potential markets and fit the right size equipment to those markets. We size the equipment to the market demand, even if it means going to smaller equipment. I am not concerned about how many people I can carry, as much as I am about how many people I can carry profitably.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Robert Ross may not have understood or appreciated government regulations too well, but he certainly understood and appreciated what his customers wanted. Their biggest concern was with the safe disposal of solid hazardous waste that could not be easily burned. Incineration of liquid wastes was relatively easy, but disposal of solids was so difficult that many commercial incinerators would not touch them. Years ago Ross and his son Gary began experimenting with better ways to handle the incineration of solids. After years of experimentation, they came up with a technology that enabled Ross Incineration Services to incinerate solids profitably and made it a technological leader in this important segment of the industry.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">LINKING TECHNOLOGY AND ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just as the market can energize the development of technology, organization can too. When the demand and price for incineration of solid wastes skyrocketed in the early 1980s, Ross Incineration found giant Fortune 500 companies literally standing in line to avail themselves of its services. Its only problem was that the technology it employed for handling solids required frequent shutdowns for cleaning and maintenance. As a result the incinerator was operating less than three weeks in the month.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To meet the demands of its customers, it became essential for the company to keep the incinerator operating at the highest levels of efficiency with the minimum of unscheduled shutdowns. Maureen Cromling and Gary Ross realized that they did not have the organizational structure in place to achieve and maintain such high levels of performance on their incinerator. So they hired in a new vice president of operations and a more qualified plant manager to build up a structure that could achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. New systems were put in to monitor and analyze performance of the equipment. Detailed schedules and preventive maintenance procedures were established to reduce down-time to an absolute minimum. Coordination between sales, transportation, the loading dock, and the testing laboratory were improved to ensure non-stop flow of materials. Virtually every activity and system related to the incinerator were reviewed and upgraded to improve performance. The new organization enabled Ross to increase the annual through-put of the incinerator by nearly 100%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Organization can have an energizing impact on R&amp;D as well as on production. The structure of R&amp;D should be tailored to the unique needs of that department, with somewhat of an academic as distinct from a purely commercial atmosphere. We have already described the type of organization Linear Technology uses to bring out the creativity of its chip designers-close coordination with production and the market and freedom to choose the products they work on.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The research division at Gartner Group is structured to provide maximum freedom to the individual researchers within well-defined guidelines. The division is divided into more than a dozen service groups focusing on different aspects of the computer industry. The research method has been systematized to ensure consistency and uniformity. There is also a quality control manager to ensure accuracy and objectivity. In addition there are weekly product meetings at which researchers present their findings to their peers, who may challenge and openly criticize them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gartner&#39;s research division is plagued by one inherent organizational weakness. The job of a program director, as presently defined, is so complex and demanding that the company has difficulty recruiting people to fill these positions. &quot;My biggest fear,&quot; says vice president Craig Symons, &quot;is how are we going to meet our personnel requirements in the future. We expect the program directors to be the world&#39;s best presenters, prolific writers, good on the phone with customers, gurus on their special field.&quot; This illustrates to what extent the structure of an organization can influence the development of technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PEOPLE AND TECHNOLOGY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The development of technology is directly linked to the way a company recruits, trains and motivates people. Gartner has a very rigorous recruitment screening process to ensure that it selects only the very best candidates. All applicants have to prepare reports and make their presentations to demonstrate the verbal and written skills. In the past, Gideon Gartner himself conducted training programs for the researchers to ensure that they fully understand the company&#39;s approach to information research. Earlier we described the unique salary incentive system Gartner employs to ensure that researchers remain highly sensitive to the needs of the customer and do not get carried away by their interest in the subject for its own sake.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGIZING TECHNOLOGY IN YOUR COMPANY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the know-how of your business.

Chances are the first word in reply will be &quot;money&quot;-capital. Capital is a reincarnation of the fickle, Greek goddess of Fortune. Everything seems to depend on her generosity and benevolence. At least that is how we perceive it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But no enlightened 20th Century businessman need be subjected to the whims and fancies of an ancient goddess. Capital is a power which can be attracted, mastered and harnessed for productive purposes by any company. In the last chapter, we looked at ways to make the market respond to your company and generate higher sales. As the market is attracted to companies which create the right internal conditions, so is capital. In this chapter we examine ways to make money move toward your company and generate higher profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Capital differs from the other four components. It is at once a productive resource and a result of productive work. It is an essential requirement for the activities of a company and an essential end result of those activities too. Capital and profit are two different forms of the same thing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Capital is a symbol of productive power. It contains all the other components within itself in potential. It can be converted into many different forms and used to stimulate the growth of any of the other components-to purchase or develop technology, hire people, build organization and develop a market. The linkage and interrelationship between capital and the other components is a key to energizing capital and converting it into an engine of growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">HOW TO MAKE MONEY COME TO YOU?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Larry Frederick must have known the answer to this question in 1981, otherwise he never would have consented to leave a secure executive position at International Teledyne Waterpik to become CEO of a company with a long history of research-and little else. Imagine trying to convince investors to put more money into a public company on the verge of bankruptcy, which has spent $4 million over 13 years trying to make toothpaste and never sold a single tube full. But that is exactly what Frederick did when he joined Vipont Pharmaceuticals and walked into what he later described as &quot;a total disaster.&quot; Frederick spent the first 18 months restructuring the company to make it financially viable and talking to financial institutions, shareholders and the investment community to raise more money. The analysts were in unanimous agreement. &quot;It&#39;s impossible!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Finally Frederick and his team came up with an imaginative solution. They created a new R &amp; D partnership which would raise money and conduct research, then sell the research results to the parent company. The research would generate a good tax write-off for investors and enable Vipont to spend more on research without showing further losses on its balance sheet. The idea worked. Vipont was able to raise $1.25 million to carry on its research and bring the toothpaste to market. In fact, it worked so well that within two years Vipont bought back the partnership and paid the investors three times their original capital in return. By then Vipont was able to go to Wall Street and raise further capital through a fresh $4 million stock offering.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Vipont&#39;s success is a dramatic example of making capital respond to the needs of a business. Two things made it possible. First, the experienced management understood the close linkage between capital and the other components. They knew that having a good technology and even a good market for its products were not enough. They understood what had to be done to build up all five components of the business to make the company profitable and attractive to investors. They drew up a comprehensive strategic plan for developing all five components, so that investors could see that the company had a viable basis and tremendous scope for growth. In other words, they created the five components in essence before seeking finance to create them in fact.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Second, they believed in the hidden potentials of the component capital and knew how to tap them to convert capital into an engine for growth. According to vice president of finance, Larry Holt, who has been with the company since 1973, &quot;We have always been able to finance ourselves. We are creative enough to do unusual things. Capital has never been a constraint on our growth. We have always raised the capital we needed without resorting to a leverage type of financing. We&#39;ve always stayed away from debt and had equity.&quot; Michelle Morgan added, &quot;I almost think we are better at raising capital than we are at selling products, and I think we are excellent at selling products. We have built up a good track record that has made the capital funding easier.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CREATIVE FINANCING</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Robert Swanson and four other people left National Semiconductor to start up Linear Technology, they had a wealth of managerial experience, technological expertise, and organizational know-how, and market knowledge. What they needed was money. Their plan was so solid, that venture capitalists offered $15 million to fund the new company in return for a 60% share in the business. The entrepreneurs almost accepted the proposal, but then decided to think creatively. So instead they persuaded a real estate builder to borrow $3.5 million from his own bankers and put up a building for Linear to lease from him. They also found a leasing company that was willing to lease $9 million in equipment for their production facility based on 20% collateral security. So they went back to the venture capitals and said they wanted only $4.5 million and offered a 40% share of the business in return. The surprised investors reluctantly agreed. By investing only $500,000 of their own money, the entrepreneurs got 60% of a $15 million startup company. That is creativity!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In an enterprising business environment like ours, society is constantly creating new ways to raise capital for business. Companies that need funds for growth should concentrate on developing all the five components of their business and maintaining a balance between them. They should be constantly thinking and looking for innovative ways to attract capital for non-stop expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SOME SIMPLE, BUT POWERFUL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In an earlier chapter we discussed the many different ways to motivate and energize people for greater productivity, profitability, growth and enjoyment. There are many ways to energize capital too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Give it the attention it deserves</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Like people, capital responds to attention. Companies give attention to capital through the way they account for money and other assets. It may sound surprising, but many companies do not know what they earn or what they make-especially companies that are in financial trouble. The crisis that hit Waltz Brothers came as a surprise, because the owners had always taken profits for granted and never insisted on accurate or timely accounts. One entrepreneur was driving down the Hollywood freeway when he received a call from his accountant telling him he was bankrupt. The businessman responded in disbelief, &quot;But how could that be? My sales are up by 25% over last year.&quot; To which the accountant replied, &quot;That&#39;s true, but your expenses are up by 35%!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It took Iacocca quite some time to really understand the depth of Chrysler&#39;s troubles, because it took that long to sort out the real meaning of numbers on the income statement and the balance sheet. Some companies strive so hard to conceal the bad news from Wall Street through favorable accounting adjustments that they successfully conceal it from themselves as well, until it is too late.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of the worst offending areas is inventory. From very small companies to very large, keeping an accurate count and valuation of inventory is a task many find daunting, because accurate inventory accounting requires flawless systems at virtually every point connected to the product from inspection of incoming shipments and correct data entry to writing of sales receipts and control of inventory transfers. Fred Lokoff&#39;s Bryn Mawr Stereo in Pennsylvania has one of the best inventory control systems we have encountered in a retail business. Lokoff&#39;s system enables him to carefully manage inventory levels to obtain more than six turns a year on his inventory, compared with an industry average of less than 3.5 turns for audio video electronics stores. This means that with the same amount of capital, he can finance 70% more business than the average store in his industry. Lokoff&#39;s financial systems have paid off: &quot;In twenty years in business, I have never had a year where I have done less business or made less profit than the year before. The only thing that has happened in bad years is that the increase was smaller.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Accounts should be up-to-date</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Sounds easy? Then, why in the world is it so uncommon? Look at any company that is losing money. Chances are very good that its accounts are far behind schedule. Typically such companies complete their accounts just in time to go to their bankers for further finance or to pay taxes. You can hear an infinite variety of explanations for slow accounting, yet the fact remains that getting and keeping accounts up-to-date has a great power-and it is not easy. Vance Pflanz, founder of Pflanz Electronics in Sioux City, Iowa developed and installed in his store an on-line system that tells him the company&#39;s daily profit at the end of every working day.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">How long does it take your company to close the books at the end of each month and find out how much it made or lost? Every day&#39;s delay is a real de-energizer to the growth of your business. Close the gap and watch the results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Conventional wisdom says that companies should pay their bills as slowly as possible and collect receivables from others as quickly as they can. But there is a deeper, more profound wisdom, whose validity the most successful companies have discovered, that says</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">pay your bills as quickly as you can and collect receivables as quickly as you can too</span><span class="c3">. There is a logic behind this wisdom. How enthusiastic would your employees be if they were never quite sure if and when they would be getting their paychecks? Paying others quickly goes a long way in energizes them in their relationship with your company. The energy and commitment of a supplier who is positively disposed and appreciative can be as powerful a driving force for growth as the positive attitude of your most important customers. Winning over your vendors is worth ten times more than the deals a company can make or the interest it can save by slowing down payments to suppliers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Use the accounts as an active instrument</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The word accounting is commonly used to refer to two related but distinct activities. Many companies use accounting primarily as a passive tool for recording and monitoring income and expenditure. But accounting can also be employed as an active instrument and powerful tool for monitoring and improving the performance of any business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Gartner Group produces an income statement within seven days after closing its books at the end of every month. The statement details the performance of every department and service which the company offers and shows which ones are making and losing money. Management closely monitors financial performance and acts quickly to cancel unprofitable services. &quot;The key to success is to stop an idea in time when it is not working,&quot; says vice president of finance, Bernard Denoyer.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">AMRE completes 175 home remodelling jobs around the country every day. Within two days, corporate controller Dennie Brown knows exactly how much the company earned on each individual job. When the company opens a new office in a new area, this system enables it to adjust its pricing immediately to a profitable level, without waiting till the end-month financials are ready to know whether it lost or earned money. &quot;If something is changing, the managers know immediately,&quot; says Brown. &quot;They don&#39;t even care about month-end financials, because they already know their results.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It also enables AMRE to identify the precise characteristics of profit-making jobs, so that the marketing department knows what they should and should not be selling. &quot;We have parameters set up to tell us what works in terms of prices, commissions, labor costs, material costs, etc.,&quot; Brown says.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Both of these companies utilize accounting as an active tool for making up-to-the-minute management decisions that directly impact on the bottom line. That requires up-to-the-minute accounting.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Use cost accounting as an index of performance</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Mike Zazanis of Audio Associates in Fairfax, Virginia bought out a struggling retail business, he scrutinized the business&#39;s financial statements with a magnifying glass to find out why it was losing money. Then he took meticulous efforts to eliminate all wasteful and unnecessary expenditures. But no matter what he did, one thing kept bothering him: the cost of electricity. All his experience told him it should not exceed 1% of gross sales, yet even after putting in electricity saving lighting, it still exceeded 3%. He began to suspect the air conditioner was at fault, so he called in an expert to check it. It checked out fine. He continued his efforts without success, but could not trace the reason for the high electricity bill. Finally he asked a friend to check the air conditioner again. The friend came back with this report: &quot;The air conditioner works just fine. But every time you turn it on, the heater goes on too!&quot; Zazanis was able to eliminate the waste of electricity and even get a refund from the owner for the building for the excess charges he had paid in previous months. This one change added 1.5% to his bottom line and helped turn the company from losses to profits. That is the power of using the numbers constructively.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saving money vs. cutting costs</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The most profitable companies are not the ones that constantly cut costs across the board. They are the ones that know how to save money. The cost cutters achieve marginal short term profit gains at the expense of mid-term growth and long term profitability. Cutting costs means to look at expenses, say they are too high and order someone to reduce them-without the knowledge or understanding of how that reduction will really impact on the future of your business. The cost cutter says: Do not hire more people, regardless of the need; postpone putting in that system, in spite of what it will do to improve quality or efficiency; live with the cramped quarters, even if they impact on morale and productivity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cost cutting is a negative activity. It achieves its results through contraction. Whereas saving money is a positive and expansive activity that achieves its results by raising the quality and quantity of performance. Saving money means to carefully analyze every job, system and activity, then ask: How can we do it better or for less money? Saving money requires clear goals, an intimate knowledge of the business, and a genuine commitment to building up the company to higher levels of performance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express is firmly committed to saving every cent it can, provided that saving takes them a step closer to realizing Smith&#39;s vision of the future and provided it does not contradict the company&#39;s commitment to its core values-people, service, safety, etc. Since 1975 Federal Express has brought down the cost of transporting a package from $9.15 to $2.70. This achievement is not the result of scrupulous cost cutting. It is the result of a constant effort to improve the overall efficiency of the system at every conceivable point.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express looks at every operation from the viewpoint of how it can help reduce the overall cost of handling a package, so that costs and prices can be further decreased and volumes can be further increased. This is how the company stumbled on the ideas of lengthening the body frame of its planes to add an extra container, introducing interactive video to reduce the number of training days for pilots, using peelable labels to save courier time, and countless other cost innovations. All these improvements are generated by a positive, expansive attitude of wanting to do things better, not one of wanting to cut jobs or travel expenses.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company constantly monitors critical success factors, such as the cost of transport per available ton mile, ATM. Currently the ATM is around 36-37 cents. The company&#39;s goal is to reduce it to 32 cents by 1992. So it looks at every activity to see how it can be improved to help achieve that goal. Every department in the air operations division is asked to scrutinize its activities to see what can be done to reduce flying time, reduce maintenance costs, increase productivity, etc. Each manager is asked to determine the performance parameters on which his or her department should be evaluated. Jim Reidmeyer, senior vice president of the division, says: &quot;Don&#39;t force measurements down on people. They must buy into them. They must perceive them as reasonable. If there is a productivity improvement, it is not going to come from some finance guy. It is going to come from the ground level.&quot; The guiding light for saving money is adherence to the company&#39;s values. Reidmeyer constantly tells his managers: &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the bean counters in finance raining death and destruction down on you. Don&#39;t change or compromise our values, whatever you do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The key to saving money at Federal Express is not overzealous cost cutting. It is an insistence on a proper balance between all the essentials of the business. &quot;I don&#39;t believe in the least cost approach. I want to demonstrate improved production efficiency,&quot; Reidmeyer says. &quot;You earn your future in the airline business by displaying a balance of technical, operational and economic excellence.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Capital can energize people</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The right financial indicators can be powerful people motivators. Gartner Group employs an index called Net Contract Value Increase, NCVI, which Gideon Gartner learned while he was working at IBM. Gartner sells its services on an annual contract basis, and it measures everything in terms of its impact on the total value of contracts. Sales people are paid commission only on the net increase in contracts they have on the books from one period to the next. As its name implies, NCVI measures the net increase in the value of total contracts on hand from one period to the next. This implies that they lose commission for any contract that is not renewed. The company uses NCVI to set budgets for its growth on each service it offers and for evaluating the performance of sales people, service managers and researchers. Gartner has a 15 year plan to reach revenues of $750 million by the year 2000. Everything has been reduced to NCVI goals. According to Gideon Gartner, the NCVI measure motivates sales people to sell on an average twice as much business as competitors. It even motivates the service managers and researchers to concentrate on growth. Because of NCVI, &quot;the people providing the product really are focussed on growing the business. That promotes entrepreneurism even among the people who are just writing research.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Henry Triesler of Precision Grinding Inc. in Phoenix developed a simple indicator that has had tremendous impact on the motivation of his people and the profitability of his grinding business. Highly paid skilled workmen in this industry are paid on an hourly basis. Work for customers is also quoted on an estimate of total man-hours required to complete it. Triesler developed a system to measure the amount of revenue the company earns from the work completed by each workman in terms of revenue dollars per hour. Performance of each worker on each job, each day and each week is tracked and reported to the shop manager and the individual workers. When the new measure was first introduced, the average shop rate was $37 per hour. Within 18 months, the average had risen to $52 per hour-without any direct linkage between performance on the index and compensation.-and the company went from 10.6% losses to 11.6% profits. A simple index increased productivity by 40% and turned a losing business into a very profitable one.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Be sure your measures really reflect the result you want to achieve. A company measuring the net earnings of each of its branch offices ran out of cash, because the system encouraged each branch to accumulate high inventories to ensure they had materials to sell. The system did not take into account the cost of the inventories they carried or the number of turns each office achieved. It did not measure or reward good inventory management, so branch managers ignored that aspect of their jobs.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In order for financial measures to motivate people, they should be simple and easy to understand. Buzz Jensen introduced a complex commission system for his sales people to encourage and reward them for selling the right products at the right prices to maximize the company&#39;s profits. In practice the sales people found the system so difficult to understand that it did not serve as a guide for their sales strategies at all. When he simplified the system and made it easy to understand, the sales force immediately took up the cues and improved the company&#39;s margins.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Financial measures should not only be easy to understand. They should be easy to calculate and track too. One company became so obsessed with using numbers to motivate that it negotiated different commission arrangements with each of its branch managers and their key staff. The system was so difficult to manage that the central accounting department needed sixty accountants to handle the work that would normally be done by thirty people in a company of this size.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Attitude is critical</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The moment you talk about money, people get up-tight, especially those who are responsible for paying it out or collecting it. Everyone who handles money exercises a great power. It can be used to intimidate people or threaten them, either overtly or subtly-just a day&#39;s or a week&#39;s unexplained delay in payment is enough to do it. In order to make capital a positive energizing power, it should only be used in a positive way by people with a positive attitude. Taking a positive and expansive attitude toward spending and collecting money is not easy, but it can be very energizing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dennie Brown of AMRE tells his accounting staff: &quot;On pay day you are in the attitude business. If a salesman doesn&#39;t dot an &#39;i&#39; or cross a &#39;t&#39;, pay him anyway. If you try to teach him a lesson, he is going to have a bad attitude and he is not going to go out and sell a job that night.

We defined rapid growth as doubling revenues or profits in 12 to 24 months, but added that for some companies a much higher rate of growth is possible. To us, doubling refers to the maximum rate of growth in revenues and profits which a company wants and believes it can achieve.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the first thirteen chapters of this book, we have described different aspects of the process for doubling. We began by challenging some of the basic myths and superstitions about growth that limit our awareness, tie up our energies and prevent us from achieving what is actually well within our reach. In the second chapter we looked at the five engines, each of which contains vast, untapped potentials for the growth of any company. Chapter Three explains how the maximum power of these five engines is released when they are developed in a balanced and harmonious manner. Next we described the process by which companies release, direct, channel and convert energy to achieve high performance, high profitability and rapid growth. The fifth chapter explains how energy that is normally dispersed and wasted can be conserved and harnessed for maximum results. In Chapter Six we explored ways to increase awareness of emerging opportunities in the external environment as a means to release and mobilize more energy for growth. The next two chapters focused on the power of values to raise the process of energy generation and conversion to the highest level in your company. Chapters Nine to Thirteen present practical strategies to energize each of the five components of your business-people, organization, market, technology and capital-and convert them into engines for rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In this chapter, we attempt to tie all these ideas together and apply them in your company through practical strategies for accelerated growth. These strategies are divided into three major categories-partial and comprehensive strategies to energize the company from above downward and isolated strategies that work to energize each individual from below upwards.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">AN ACCOUNTANT&#39;S TREASON</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In 1982 an accountant named Eduardo Malone was appointed president of the $275 million industrial division of the $2 billion French conglomerate Chargeurs s.a.. Chargeurs is an amalgamation of century old companies whose operations include U.T.A. airlines, textiles, a truck manufacturing division and a shipping line. The company is owned by one of the wealthiest men in France, Jerome Seydoux of the Schlumberger family. The appointment of Malone as president of this conservative, traditional company was an extraordinary event. Chargeurs was a company which respected age and family heritage. Malone had neither. He was only 36 years old and he was an Argentinian, who had previously been controller in one of Chargeurs&#39; Argentine subsidiaries. The appointment was so unusual that when Malone first broke the news to his wife, she exclaimed, &quot;Why, that&#39;s treason!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Malone moved to Paris and took up his new position, he found a company with notable strengths and weaknesses. Its greatest strength was in the component technology, where it excelled in engineering and production know-how. There was a predominance of family members in top management who possessed intelligence and education but lacked professional management skills. The company maintained a paternalistic relationship with its people, providing good compensation and benefits and jobs for many of their children. There was a dynamic, entrepreneurial culture in the overseas operations. In the foreign subsidiaries authority was decentralized and managers were given a great deal of freedom. In contrast, the organization in France was highly centralized, bureaucratic and authoritarian.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Malone&#39;s assignment was to improve the financial performance of the industrial division, which had earned less than one percent profit the previous year, as soon and as much as possible. Everyone was watching and expecting Malone to fail. Apart from an MBA degree and his experience in Argentina, Malone brought to his new job a deep personal belief in people and a sense of responsibility to the welfare of those who worked for him. At the head office he found people working in an atmosphere of fear and insecurity, where ideas were stifled and individual initiative was discouraged. He decided that the greatest urgency and greatest potential lay in the company&#39;s people. Despite the company&#39;s poor performance and the pressure he was under for quick results, he announced that no one in the company would be fired. With the help of his management team, he identified all those managers in the company who were not performing adequately and he approached each one of them individually with the following question: &quot;How can I help you do your job better?&quot; He encouraged people to speak out their ideas and suggestions and pushed authority to lower levels to empower people to act on their own initiative.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The results of these changes were startling. People who had felt frightened and constricted became expansive and excited. Not only those who had feared for their jobs, but all those who felt demotivated and discouraged began to express fresh energy in their work. The result, as Malone described it, was &quot;Profits exploded!&quot; In one year the net income of the industrial division rose eight-fold, from .75% to over 6% of revenues. That was the power Malone released by giving positive attention to his people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">PARTIAL STRATEGIES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The dramatic growth in profits at Chargeurs is an example of a partial strategy for releasing the energies of a company for higher profits or revenues. We call a strategy partial, when it focuses on tapping the potentials from one aspect of the business, either one of the five components or one of the thirty values listed earlier.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the preceding chapters, we have cited many examples to illustrate that harnessing the energy from even one of these areas is sufficient to substantially increase revenues or profits or both. Bang &amp; Olufsen of America grew by 35% in a year by energizing the component market through its commitment to the value of customer service. Precision Grinding Inc. converted a 11% loss into 12% profit within a year, primarily by focusing on improving its financial systems and performance on quality and on-time delivery.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">BEN &amp; JERRY&#39;S</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s is not a company that anyone would take seriously, if it were not for the company&#39;s impressive record of growth from $614,000 to $45 million in seven years. A partial strategy has been the driving force for that growth-commitment to two powerful corporate values, quality and service to society.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company insists on very high quality standards, which include less than half the amount of air used in most other brands of ice cream. Every year tons of ice cream are thrown away, just because they do not meet the company&#39;s stringent requirements for perfect texture and blending. Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s has actually pioneered in the development of improved machinery to permit blending of larger and heavier add-in ingredients.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s social mission has been the subject of much debate both within and outside the company, but its role in the company&#39;s growth is undeniable. It has had an energizing impact on people, the market and the community. When the company went public in 1984, it offered the shares for sale only to residents of its native Vermont. The company supports local industry by purchasing only Vermont milk products at a premium price. Both these actions have won loyalty and support from the local population. In order to promote a more egalitarian, family feeling, it maintains a maximum five to one ratio between the pay of executives and hourly workers. The company also does what it calls &quot;socially-conscious marketing,&quot; which means it spends most of its advertising dollars sponsoring public radio and folk concerts. Recently the company introduced a new product, called Peace Pops, of which 1% of the sales proceeds is being donated to the cause of world peace. The company&#39;s commitment to quality and serving society has made its market respond.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">MATCHING STRATEGIES WITH GOALS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Most of the companies referred to in this book have achieved very high rates of growth and high levels of profitability by focusing on one or two components or one or two key corporate values. Mesa Airlines&#39; real strength has been in careful financial control and proper matching of its equipment to meet the needs of the market. Gartner has excelled in systematizing its research process and energizing its people through an innovative compensation package and a lot of freedom. Vipont&#39;s greatest strengths have been in creative financing and innovative research.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The companies referred to in this book are not held up as models of perfection. We cannot even state with confidence that all of them will continue to perform as well in the future as they have in the past. In fact, if the subject of this book had been how the lack of balanced development retards and limits growth, we could cite some of the same companies as examples, since most of them have significant weaknesses off-setting their impressive strengths. But our purpose has been to show how even the development of one or two components or one or two values to a high degree can energize a company and raise it to a far higher level in its industry. All of these companies have tapped the potentials of at least one area and grown dramatically as a result. Not that we advocate or recommend such a one-sided approach. But if your company&#39;s goal is only to double or triple in size, a partial strategy, which focuses on one component or one value that is relatively weak, is more than sufficient in most cases to accomplish that limited purpose.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">However, if your company&#39;s goal is something more than a mere doubling, a partial strategy may not be for you. If, for instance, your goal is to become the leader in your area or your industry, locally, nationally or internationally, you need a comprehensive strategy for accelerating the growth of your company through the process described in this book.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGIES</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have described two aspects of the process of growth. The five components are the resources and engines. Each is an inexhaustible source of energy. The bringing together of these five to form a business is the creative act that releases the energy of the components and turns them into engines for growth. The interaction between the components is a creative process which continuously generates new opportunities. Since each component by itself is limitless and the possible combinations and interactions are countless, the creative potentials of their inter-relationships are infinite.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The five components are like the structure of an atom or molecule-a finite number of atomic or subatomic particles combining and interacting in countless different ways to form an infinite variety of forms and physical forces. Science has uncovered the physical and chemical processes by which atomic and molecular energies are released from the atom and molecule and recombined to produce more complex substances and more powerful, more intelligent forms of life. The physics and chemistry by which the five components release their energies and recombine to produce more powerful and productive types of companies is the process of energy conversion described in Chapter Four.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Any company that fully understands the structure of the five components and their interactions and the process of energy conversion can launch itself on a never-ending cycle of growth that generates higher revenues and higher profits year after year and decade after decade. This is not just an abstract possibility. There are many companies that have done it more or less consciously and continuously. Because they have done so for an extended period of time, they are very large corporations today-companies such as AT&amp;T, Delta Airlines, Dupont, IBM, Merck and Northwestern Mutual Life.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But the moment companies of this awesome size are mentioned, the average $1 million, $10 million or $100 million company thinks, &quot;What has that got to do with me?&quot; The answer is, &quot;Everything.&quot; IBM was once a $12 million company too. The very fact that there is a process by which one company has grown 5,000-fold from $12 million to $60 billion should be a source of inspiration to every company that has a more modest goal, because one company&#39;s achievement proves that it is possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Regardless of whether your company is a $600,000 company reaching for $6 million like Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s was in 1981, or a $7 million company striving for $70 million like Linear Technology was in 1984, or a $22 million company aiming for $200 million like AMRE was in 1985, or a $258 million company shooting for over $4 billion like Federal Express in 1979, the process is the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Because these companies did many different things to propel their growth and because that growth takes place over a number of years, it is difficult for us to clearly see the relationship between their actions and the results. Therefore, the most dramatic and revealing examples of the process are those which involve a sudden change in direction or policy that results in a sudden change in performance. We have already described dramatic changes of this type at SAS, London Life, C &amp; J Industries, Bang &amp; Olufsen, and Waltz Brothers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGIZING A LIFE SAVER</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The same process occurred more recently when Howard Cooper took over as CEO of Trimedyne in early 1988. At the time, Trimedyne was a company with one marked strength, technology. The company developed and was marketing a high-tech medical device called a laserscope, which can be inserted into a patient&#39;s arteries and used to destroy arterial plaque. Plague is the cause of the arterial blockages that until recently could only be treated by surgery.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When Trimedyne received approval from the Federal Drug Administration to market the laserscope in February 1987, the company was caught unprepared. It had 65 people and sales of $5.7 million. There was no real marketing function, no marketing strategy, no sales organization or sales systems. The company did not even maintain a record of customers for its earlier products, so that they could be contacted to buy the laserscope. Its small production facility was unable to meet demand. The limited manufacturing capacity worried Wall Street analysts, who felt that Trimedyne could not deliver on its orders. There was no qualified financial manager, no financial controls, no forecasting, no budgets, no business plan, not even a credit or collection department. There was no personnel function either, no standard wage and salary scales. The company also lacked experienced managers and management information systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In other words, Trimedyne had one developed component and little else. Driven by the engine technology, the company&#39;s sales doubled in 1986 to just over $12 million. But in the absence of the four components, the company could not go very much further. Cooper was brought in by the Board of Directors, because he was a very experienced executive, who had earlier purchased a struggling medical equipment manufacturing company for $60 million, built it up and resold it for $140 million. After joining Trimedyne, he quickly set about assessing the company&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and taking steps to build up the weaker components.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cooper&#39;s first major step was to set a clear direction for the growth of the company. Along with other executives, he developed a mission statement and drew up a strategic plan, which gave a new direction to both marketing and research. The company stopped development and marketing of other medical devices which it had been making in order to focus on the area of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, it widened the field of research beyond the laserscope to cover other high technology methods to remove plaque. Through the plan, Cooper also established clear goals for each department to work towards. &quot;Previously, the company was task-oriented as opposed to goal-oriented,&quot; Cooper explained.&quot; Now we have tasks as an orientation, but all within the framework of goals.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the component market, Cooper recruited and trained a team of clinical specialists to educate the public about the advantages of laserscope therapy over other forms of treatment. He doubled the sales force and built up a regional sales management structure. By carefully analyzing the country&#39;s demographics, he discovered that 70% of the company&#39;s market fell within 17 states, so he decided to concentrate the sales effort on that target territory.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">As a businessman and not a technologist, Cooper understood the power of attuning technology to the needs of the market.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;Any company that has some technology can find a small market and grow to $500,000 or $2 million a year. But to grow beyond that there must be a vital difference...Companies run by engineers or technicians without reference to the market typically fail. Usually companies develop technology before they understand the market.</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">I believe technology must take a lead from the market.</span><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To improve coordination between these two components, sales people were asked to report back their experiences directly to the research staff and research engineers were sent out into the field to meet physicians and sense the needs of the market. This coordination led to significant improvements in the product line. The company also accelerated its clinical research program to enable the sales staff to document the advantages of its technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cooper strengthened the component people by recruiting qualified individuals with managerial experience for key positions in engineering, finance, sales, marketing, quality control and personnel. &quot;We can&#39;t reach the next plateau of revenues, unless we bring on enough of the right people and incur the expense early enough,&quot; he explained. To ensure that people and technology stayed in balance, he cataloged the company&#39;s research projects to assess future manpower requirements and drew up a plan to meet them. He also brought in a consultant to develop competitive wage and salary scales to ensure the company could attract all the people it needed. A generous bonus and incentive program was also introduced. At the end of 1988 the company paid bonuses to every employee in the company equal to 13% of corporate net income.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The company also made a major effort to build up the systems it needs to function smoothly and efficiently as it grows. New systems were introduced for monitoring sales performance, managing R &amp; D expenditure, controlling manufacturing costs, and providing marketing information. Cooper found that no distinction was being made between orders booked and orders shipped, so that monitoring the order backlog was impossible. Therefore, he introduced a computerized system to track bookings and shipments by product line.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cooper modified the company&#39;s manufacturing plans to bring them into balance with marketing forecasts. In order to augment production quickly to meet rising demand, the company went to outside manufacturers to supplement its own capacity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The component finance was so poorly developed that Cooper chose to replace the entire department with more qualified people. Then he introduced detailed financial planning and budgeting.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Cooper understood that in order for Trimedyne to keep growing and become a dominant force in its field, it had to develop in a balanced manner. &quot;There are several areas that we have to excel in, not only in technology and the quality of that technology. We have to also excel in marketing skills, in expense control, in asset utilization...It is important to build a strong management team which can make decisions to encompass finance, marketing, technology and manufacturing. I really believe in the theory of the ubiquitous manager.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The result of these efforts to build up each of the five components and to energize them by closely integrating each with the other four had a sensational effect. In one year the company&#39;s revenues increased 250% from $12 million in 1987 to $31 million in 1988. Net income during the same period rose more than 1000% from $494,000 to $5.3 million or 17% of revenues.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THREE ASPECTS OF THE PROCESS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is nothing which Cooper did that cannot be done by any company. Trimedyne&#39;s growth is impressive, both because it is so rapid and because it is based on a comprehensive and balanced effort to release the potentials of all five components.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process which took place at Trimedyne in a period of one year is the process by which every company grows, regardless of whether that growth is swift and continuous or slow and halting. The process has three fundamental aspects:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">1. Development of the inherent capacities of each of the five components.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">2. Linkage and coordination of the components with one another to attune them to a common purpose and form an integral whole.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">3. This development and coordination are achieved by releasing energy, directing it to achieve corporate values and goals, channeling it through appropriate organizational structures and expressing it with the right skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Although the process always has these common dimensions, it can vary considerably in terms of its speed, intensity and comprehensiveness. It can also vary in one other important respect: the type or level of energy released and harnessed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THREE LEVELS OF ENERGY CONVERSION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In an earlier chapter, we described three graded levels of energy that can be released and channeled for growth:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">1. </span><span class="c4">Physical</span><span class="c3">. The first level is the physical energy we express through hard work. Physical energy is released when people are disciplined, hard working and interested in the work. This energy is reflected in a company by alert, brisk movements and a clean work environment.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">2. </span><span class="c4">Organizational</span><span class="c3">. The next higher level is the social or organizational energy we express when people work together in an organized manner to achieve common goals. This energy is released when there are smooth running systems, good communication and cooperation between people and departments.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">3. </span><span class="c4">Individual</span><span class="c3">. The highest level is the mental or psychological energy of the individual, which is released by commitment to inspiring values. This energy expresses in intense individual involvement, personal growth, continuous creativity, a constant sense of freshness and fulfillment.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process of energy conversion can take place at any of these levels with any one or mixture of these three types of energy. The process which occurred at Trimedyne was predominantly physical. This was necessarily so, because the company lacked even the basic physical structures needed for the development of the five components. The process involved recruiting people, adding new positions, installing systems, expanding the sales force and production capabilities, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The effort which Lee Iacocca made to save Chrysler in the early 1980s was also predominantly physical. Here, of course, the basic constituents of the five components were already in place, but the energies of the company were stifled and scattered in all directions. Iacocca had to release and redirect those energies more effectively and efficiently to improve the performance of the company. Under the impending threat of corporate bankruptcy and the even more imminent fear to the workers of losing their jobs, he had to restore discipline among an assertive and intractable unionized work force. In actuality, 34 vice presidents, countless white collar workers and tens of thousands of blue collar workers did lose their jobs. He had to impose coordination between isolated and narrow-minded departments. He had to literally force design engineers, production engineers and marketing people to talk with one another and produce a car which was well-designed and well-built. He even had to threaten Congress with the political consequences of letting the company sink. The magnitude of Iacocca&#39;s effort and achievement were heroic. He transformed a bankrupt, comatose giant, which every financial analyst in the country had already pronounced dead, into a dynamic, responsive, very much alive, and rapidly growing company, which not only became highly profitable, but actually doubled in size over the next five years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">REENERGIZING AN ORGANIZATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chrysler amazed America in the early 1980s by surviving its crisis and re-emerging healthy, vigorous and highly competitive. Equally extraordinary has been the radical transformation of Ford Motors in the mid-1980s and its re-emergence as the leader of the U.S. automotive industry after sixty years as a successful, but second-class citizen. The process by which Ford transformed itself into a trend-setting, pace-setting sprinter and the most profitable car-maker in the world is an example of energy conversion at the organizational level.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.8je43yh51g3w"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At its colossal inception some 80 years ago, Ford Motors shook the whole world and changed it forever. It emerged out of nowhere to become the largest, most sophisticated, mass-manufacturing company of its day. It put the price of an automobile within the reach of the common man and revolutionized life in America. As if exhausted by this remarkable effort, fifteen years later Ford was overtaken by General Motors and settled down to a life of success and mediocrity, which lasted more than half a century. In the early 1980s Ford reawoke and once again startled the business world with a feat of a different character, but almost equal in magnitude to its initial achievement.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">In 1980 Ford shared much in common with Chrysler. Its products had developed a reputation for poor design and shoddy quality. Its entire focus seemed to be on producing quantity, not quality. Its organization had become militaristic, highly bureaucratic and divided into independent fiefdoms. People seemed to be more interested in office politics and fostering their careers than in making good cars. The management style was highly autocratic. Production methods were outmoded and inefficient. The company was over-staffed and under-productive. And like Chrysler, the company was losing market share and losing money too. In 1980 it recorded a loss of $3.26 billion, and over the next few years its domestic car sales declined by 25%. &quot;Running scared,&quot; is how one leading industry analyst described the company. &quot;Ford in 1980 and 81&#39; was really looking at the end of the earth.&quot;</span><span class="c15">25</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Then suddenly the colossus awoke and in a period of three years turned itself into one of the most dynamic and profitable companies in the country. The turnaround was orchestrated by Philip Caldwell, who succeeded Henry Ford II as chairman in 1980, and Donald Petersen, who became president under Caldwell and then chairman in 1985. Together they instituted sweeping changes in all five components and liberated fresh torrents of energy from all parts and levels of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">One of their most significant achievements was to realign the component technology to attune it to the needs of the market. We have already described Ford&#39;s effort to find out from customers exactly what improvements they would like in an automobile, carrying back 1401 suggestions to its engineers. It invested $3 billion dollars to design rounder, aerodynamically styled cars, culminating in the development of the world&#39;s best-selling car, the Escort, and then the Taurus.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ford also energized technology by implementing the value quality through the five stages-commitment, standards, structure, systems and skills. The company brought in quality-guru Edward Deming and instituted his 14 point program for improving quality and productivity. An Employee Involvement program was instituted to get workers involved in quality improvement and give them the authority to make it happen. Plants and workers were given quality goals in place of production quotas. In one plant the percentage of engines accepted by inspectors the first time they reached the end of the line rose from 60% to 96%, while productivity increased by 27%. By 1987 Ford&#39;s quality had improved by 60%, as measured by consumer surveys and repair costs under warranty plans. Elimination of reworking due to improved quality and increasing factory automation have enabled the company to raise productivity by 36% since 1981.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.p4l0cvjifzq"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the component capital, the company introduced stringent cost cutting measures. In order to reduce production capacity to bring it in line with declining market demand, management closed 15 manufacturing facilities, including 3 U.S. assembly plants. It also cut total employment by nearly one-third. It realized a savings of $3 billion by switching to just-in-time inventory management. Now Ford achieves nine turns a year on its inventory, compared with the former six turns.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Ford energized the components people and organization by replacing the old, authoritarian management style with one based on open communication, participation and teamwork. To overcome the habits of the past, company executives underwent week long training programs at Ford&#39;s Executive Development Center on participatory management and on how to listen to subordinates. Petersen told executives, &quot;Everyone with legitimate input to your decision should have the chance to be heard.&quot;</span><span class="c15">26</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Executive bonuses and incentives were linked directly with quality and with people skills. There was an unprecedented drive to push responsibility down to lower levels of the organization.</span><a id="id.au3wa0yq5495"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">The company minutely analyzed each aspect of its operations to understand how the different parts affected each other and to find ways to improve coordination between them. The emphasis on improving communication and understanding between people had an electrifying effect on the organization and its people. Even Wall Street took note of the change. One analyst remarked: &quot;Ford has opened channels of communication. You&#39;ve got people sharing data and understanding each other&#39;s problems. Decisions are being made with more and better information, which leads to better decisions.&quot;</span><span class="c15">27</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The result of all these efforts is current history. In 1985 Ford earned $2.5 billion on sales of $52 billion. In 1986 its earnings rose 30% to $3.3 billion on revenues of $63 billion, surpassing General Motors in profitability for the first time since 1924. By 1987 the company had slashed its costs by $5 billion and lowered its break-even point by an astonishing 40%. It had also accumulated a cash surplus of $9 billion.</span><a id="id.npcpyyba75yk"></a><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Fortune</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">cited the example of Ford and six other major U.S. corporations as &quot;compelling testimony that restructuring can indeed lower break-even points substantially and</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">lead to a doubling or even tripling of earnings</span><span class="c8">.&quot;</span><span class="c15">28</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><a id="id.eky5zehamio6"></a><p class="c0"><span class="c3">And when just about everyone believed that Ford had accomplished the utmost that could be achieved, Ford&#39;s automotive division proceeded over the next two years to rack up an additional 30% rise in revenues and 39% increase in profits, closing 1988 with profits of $4.6 billion on sales of $82 billion. In three years this mega-company had increased revenues by 58% and profits by 84%.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Newsweek</span><span class="c8">&#39;s comment on Ford&#39;s dramatic turnaround is revealing. &quot;There is nothing startling or even original in Ford&#39;s better ideas: the remarkable thing is that they are so obvious and Ford once ignored them and now it embraces them.&quot;</span><span class="c15">29</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The steps which Ford took to achieve these results are an expression of the process of corporate energy conversion. The company took systematic efforts to build up the five components, to improve coordination between them and establish a greater balance. It released fresh energies from the components by a combination of strategies. The focus on reducing costs and the consequent cutting of the work force had an effect similar to the one at Chrysler. It released enormous physical energy from those who had previously felt secure and complacent. The effort at restructuring, streamlining activities and systems, and opening up communication released organizational energies. The commitment to quality, teamwork and the greater involvement of individuals at all levels in decision-making released higher level psychological energies as well. The outcome was a result of the process of energization, partially carried out at these three different levels, but predominantly at the middle level of organizational energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Chrysler and Ford illustrate the truth in the adage that great difficulties can be converted into great opportunities. Very often opportunities come to us in the form of difficulties. When we do not recognize or respond to a new opportunity when it presents itself positively, it sometimes comes back in the form of a physical pressure which we call a difficulty. If a company responds positively to that physical pressure, it releases powerful, latent energies that are pent-up below the surface and explodes into growth. Therefore, the physical pressure generated by a difficulty is often the most opportune occasion for doubling.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE PROCESS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We selected Federal Express as one of the companies to be cited in this book for two reasons. First, it is a company that has grown very fast over a very short period of time to emerge from the ranks of the small and mid-sized growth companies and enter the ranks of today&#39;s giant corporations. In this respect, it has completed the transition which AMRE, Expeditors International, Vipont and many other mid-sized growth companies aspire to achieve. It reveals the next stage of the growth process and dramatically illustrates how quickly this phase can be accomplished. Second, Federal Express is a company that has achieved its phenomenal success through a well-balanced and harmonious development of all five components, and it has energized itself for this growth by a serious commitment to a range of high corporate values including punctuality, customer service, systematic functioning, safety, open communication and development of people.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express is not a perfect company. It has made its share of mistakes and had its share of problems, such as the $500 million loss on its zap mail facsimile program. But it has gone about as far as any company we know to energize each of the five components at the third and highest level of energy conversion process-by releasing the psychological energies of the individual.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">The process of energy conversion is a living organic process. It is the process of growth. So in its highest expression it transforms an organization into a living organism with a life and vitality of its own. The energy and intensity generated at Chrysler and Ford are very impressive, but the dynamism, vitality and </span><span class="c38 c8 c39">&eacute;</span><span class="c3">lan we felt at Federal Express is of a higher order than these forces. The company is propelled, not by the fear of bankruptcy, not by the spectra of huge losses or job insecurity. It is powered and actuated by a lofty vision of a distant possibility and an aspiration to realize that vision. Not that Federal Express is lost in the clouds. There is nothing ethereal or ephemeral about this company. It is supremely practical and down-to-earth. But it is also fresh, vibrant, and alive. People in the company, like Roger Podwoski, managing director of service systems administration, feel it too:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c17 c8">&quot;There is something more alive about this company. The difference is two-fold: there is this unbelievable commitment to the customer, and employees see we are constantly improving what we do. This company talks a lot. This company is alive, and as long as it&#39;s alive you feel part of it. We are constantly looking at different ways to improve. The attitude of improvement is not just at the top.</span><span class="c6 c17 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4 c17">It goes all the way down</span><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The most noble and inspiring characteristic of being human is this aspiration for growth, the striving to go higher and be better than before, what Ted Weise called &quot;a fanatical urge to do better.&quot; That is the esprit de corps at Federal Express.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the process of growth in your company. Is your company growing as fast and as far as you want it to? If companies the size of Federal Express and Ford can grow so quickly, why should you be satisfied with anything less? What can you do to accelerate the process? What type of energy is your company releasing and expressing for its growth? Is your company tapping physical, organizational or individual energies? What can you do to elevate the process to a higher level of intensity?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Patience is a great virtue and sign of wisdom, but it can also become a rationale for accomplishing much less than you are capable of achieving. The process we are describing does not require a lot of time. As soon as the right conditions are provided, the energy is released and acts instantaneously. If you are thinking that growth has to take a long time, think again. Life is filled with examples of individuals and companies rising with lightning speed to the top. The real determinant of time is only the intensity of the aspiration that inspires you to grow.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGIZING FROM ABOVE AND BELOW</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The partial growth strategies are very potent. The comprehensive strategies are extremely powerful. Yet there is one more strategy that can be at once easier to initiate and even more effective than either of these.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The partial and comprehensive strategies start at the top of the company and work their way down. In most companies the process works something like this: The CEO has an intense aspiration or inspiring vision which releases his energy. He communicates this idea to his management team and tries to inspire them with his vision and win their enthusiastic support. The management team conceives of a plan to implement the idea and develops a consensus at the top as to what can be achieved and how. Then senior management translates the plan into practical programs for action and presents them to middle management. Middle management formulates detailed operational plans for execution by first line managers. At each step in the process both the idea and the energy to achieve it have to passed on from one person to the next, from one level to the next, so that the plan will carry the necessary power for realization. If the CEO succeeds in fully inspiring senior managers with his vision and they in turn succeed in fully enthusing middle management with their plan, then the process gains momentum and releases fresh energies at successive stages as it travels down through the organization.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When the movement is fully successful and the entire company is energized by the vision to achieve the goals of the plan, then even small, routine individual acts express something of the energy and inspiration of the overall vision. The telephone operator answers the phone with an eager, cheerful friendliness that is genuine and irresistible. The production operator works with a briskness, pride and meticulous care worthy of the finest skilled craftsman. The whole company radiates and overflows with happy, buoyant, confident, exuberant energy. This is the end result of the process of energy conversion when it releases the highest level of psychological energies and when it is taken all the way down to the level of the individual act.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Instead of starting at the top with a comprehensive strategy to energize the whole company and working down to energize successive layers of acts, it is also possible to start at the bottom at the level of individual acts and by energizing many of them release fresh energies that spread by contagion from one act to the next, from one level to the next, until ultimately they energize the whole company to the top and to its core. The essential elements of the process are the same in either case, only the direction is opposite.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process that moves from the top down starts with the CEO and with a central plan and is propelled by the authority of those at the top. The process that rises upwards from below can be initiated by any manager, any individual and spreads spontaneously in an atmosphere of freedom.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The principle underlying the comprehensive and partial strategies is that each component of the company can be managed in such a way as to release fresh, productive energy in that component and through their interrelationships in other components as well. The principle underlying the process that begins from below is that every act in a company can be carried out in such a way that it releases fresh productive energy during the act and in the people who are involved in it and by contagion in related acts and people too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When the dispatcher at P.A.M. listens attentively and sympathetically to the personal problem of a driver who is 2,000 miles away from his family, that act can evoke a response of appreciation in the driver and satisfaction in the dispatcher which spills over into other acts they perform and spreads to other people they interact with. The grateful driver may smile infectiously as he meets the next customer or go out of his way to solve the customer&#39;s problem. The dispatcher becomes more alert, because he now finds his job less monotonous and more challenging, and that alertness enables him to identify a better routing for the trucks that saves time for the customer and money for the company. One thoughtful act can energize service to the customer, human relations within the company and productive efficiency as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">FIFTEEN WAYS TO ENERGIZE AN ACT</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every act in a company can be energized, no matter how small and how routine it is. Here are some basic ways to energize an act.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Act from the other person&#39;s point of view</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This one principle is enough to transform any company into a living mountain of vibrant energy. Mayflower moving company has discovered how to convert the mundane act of knocking at a door into an act as sacred and refined as a Japanese tea ceremony. Mayflower understands how the woman of the house can feel when her husband has gone off to work and left her alone, the door bell rings, and suddenly she finds herself standing face to face with a big, burly hulk of a man, who she has never seen before in her life. The first natural conscious or subconscious reaction is fear. So Mayflower trains its moving people with the customer uppermost in mind. The movers are dressed in immaculately clean uniforms. When they approach a home for the first time, they carry a clipboard with the company name emblazoned in large letters on the back. They position the clipboard across the chest, so the name is highly visible. Then they ring the bell. Whoever answers, be it man, woman or child, the mover smiles broadly and makes eye contact, then slowly lowers his eyes down to his feet, so that the customer&#39;s eyes naturally follow and see the clean uniform and name on the clipboard. Simultaneously the mover takes a slow step backwards to signify his non-aggressive intentions. The momentary fright is avoided and replaced by a warm, positive initial meeting which carries over as a sense of confidence, security and relaxation in the customer&#39;s mind, and influences her entire experience and impression of the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Taking the other person&#39;s point of view applies to everyone-even to our subordinates! In the midst of the Great Depression, Tom Watson went down to the factory floor and asked machinery operators how their jobs could be made easier and more productive. Taking his employees&#39; point of view really energized his people and resulted in significant productivity gains as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express permits its customer service telephone agents to knit a sweater or read a novel between phone calls, because they understand how boring it can be just sitting around waiting for the phone to ring. The operators are a lot more alert and cheerful as a result.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">All outgoing, expansive movements energize, such as wanting your employees or your customers to earn more. Vipont has consciously adopted the concept of &quot;mutual benefit&quot; as corporate policy. &quot;Our goal is to provide a benefit to everybody,&quot; says CEO Larry Frederick. &quot;Our products provide a benefit to the consumer, to the dentist and hygienists, to the retailer.&quot; Employees benefit as shareholders. Dentists and hygienists, whose clients have fewer cavities to treat than in the past, are able to offer additional services to them for treating plaque. Retailers earn higher margins on Vipont products.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thoughtfulness</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is a corollary of the first principle. Give to another person a little bit more than they have reason to expect and both you and the other person will be energized. It happened to us when we called Delta Airlines for a flight from Washington National to Newark, New Jersey six years ago, and we still remember that tiny, totally insignificant little act.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Delta agent explained over the phone that the airline does not fly that route. Before we could say &quot;thank you&quot; and put down the phone, the agent told us the names of three airlines that did. This time we managed to get in a &quot;thank you&quot; before the agent asked us what time we wished to fly and proceeded to read off the departure times of six flights that might be suitable. Then after a second &quot;thank you&quot; and a second attempt to hang up, the agent asked to our amazement, &quot;Would you like the phone numbers of the other airlines?&quot; What customer would not remember a company that remembers the customer this way?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Strive for perfection</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">To do better than another is competition. It can energize you as long as you are in second place. When you achieve the goal, it leads to satisfaction. To do better than yesterday is to strive for perfection, competing against yourself. Striving for perfection continuously releases greater energy in the individual and in the act. When a company can generate this attitude in small routine acts, it leads to continuous innovation and improvements, like the three seconds saved by a peelable label at Federal Express. Every act becomes a subject for observation and possible modification. Every unconscious habit comes under conscious scrutiny. Every act gets energized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relate to the uniqueness in every act</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The surest way to take all the energy out of an act is to respond from habit to the sameness in the act. Every act is unique in some way, even if we have performed it a thousand times in the presence of the same people, because neither we nor they are ever the same again. If you relate to the uniqueness in any act and respond out of freshness, it gets energized. A door to door saleswoman goes from house to house all day presenting the same sales pitch at each stop. But the person who answers the door is never the same. Each has different thoughts, different needs, different feelings, a different face. If the saleswoman takes interest in observing those things and relating to them, her job becomes fascinating, her presentations become energized.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the same manner, every customer, every employee and every situation is unique and responds differently when we treat it that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Create a sense of ownership by giving authority</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Giving a person authority and responsibility over any act is energizing, even when the authority is over something very small. At C &amp; J Industries each worker is given authority over a few square feet of work area around his machine. In that small territory they are sovereign rulers with complete authority to enforce safety and cleanliness. Terry Crabbe of Sound Hounds gave authority over one of the store&#39;s product lines to each of his sales people. They were made responsible for maintaining the product displays, stocking and monitoring inventory levels, reordering merchandise and conducting training classes for other sales people on their product line. This policy created a very active sense of ownership, motivated the sales force and helped the company triple its profits in 1987, then raised them 60% in 1988 and another 30% in 1989.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The Federal Express hub in Memphis, the city&#39;s second largest tourist attraction, receives thousands of visitors every year. The people who act as tour guides behave like well-trained and seasoned professionals, full of useful and fascinating information, and bubbling with enthusiasm. Yet these tour guides are actually regular company employees who take up the special assignment on a rotating basis. Being asked to tell the public about their company is an enjoyable and satisfying experience for employees and makes their presentations enjoyable and satisfying to visitors too.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Federal Express customer service operators also rotate teaching classes on customer service to new batches of employees. Since every executive must take the customer service classes too, occasionally an operator finds herself giving instruction to her boss&#39;s boss&#39;s boss. That is energizing!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Put in a system wherever it is missing</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Establishing order, ease and harmony in place of chaos and confusion relieves stress and frustration and can be very energizing. The order desk at Bang &amp; Olufsen of America is run by four dedicated woman who handle hundreds of calls a day from customers wanting anything from a $12,000 stereo system to a 12&quot; replacement screw. The real challenge comes when a service technician in a repair shop, who cannot find his service manual, calls in without a part number and asks for &quot;one of those tiny black plastic things which go in the left hand corner at the back of the case.&quot; The operators just about go crazy trying to find out what part the customer needs. Two years ago one of the operators got it into her head to rectify the situation. She went out to a hardware store with her husband and bought materials to build a catalog stand for each operator and then compiled four complete sets of service manuals to stand by the operators&#39; desks. This simple system relieved tons of frustration in the order department and pleased many service technicians, who were no longer treated so roughly for calling in without a part number.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Relate an act with another act</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This is a scaled-down version of the principle of coordination. Every act is related with other acts. It either depends on them or influences them. Taking the effort to relate two or more acts which are normally carried out independently of one another relieves irritation, improves efficiency and releases energy.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Imparting or upgrading a skill energizes</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We related earlier how Dave Gray of Nedlloyd&#39;s London office was put in charge of the new computer system and asked to learn the whole thing from scratch. Dave is the most energized person in the company, and his positive attitude is positively infectious.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Implement any value in the act</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">When the guard at the parking lot gate of a Dupont factory reminds departing drivers to buckle their safety belts, he communicates in nutshell the company&#39;s fanatical commitment to safety and its intense concern for the welfare of its employees. Bringing down any value to the level of the individual act can have that same energizing impact. The smaller the act the greater the power. Every company gives excellent and prompt service to its largest, most important customers. If you give the same royal service to your smallest, least significant customer, you win that customer for life and the market rushes toward your company. If you treat even job applicants like customers, people will flock to the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The power of attitude</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A positive attitude has the power to energize any situation. When Eduardo Malone went to failing managers and asked how he could help them, his positive attitude sent waves of energy through the company. Taking a positive attitude toward poor-performing people, troublesome problems and frustrating circumstances has the power to evoke unexpected and energizing responses from other people. With the right attitude, every poor performer can be helped to improve and even tough problems get resolved.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Create challenges and opportunities for people to be successful</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This principle is a way of life at Federal Express. Karl Birkholz remarked: &quot;You can make any job challenging, if you want to. It is a manager&#39;s job to find out what turns people on...what they like.&quot; Challenges of any description are energizing. Jim Barksdale says, &quot;The most motivating thing for any member of a team is the feeling that they belong to a winning team. It transcends pay. It transcends personal ambition. It transcends almost anything.&quot; Recognize achievement and create opportunities for people to be successful. Success is a self-gratifying experience.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Give personal attention</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This principle has been fully discussed in Chapter Nine. Give personal attention and recognition to anyone or everyone. Nothing energizes more.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tools of measurement energize</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Psychologists have found that immediate feedback on performance dramatically increases the speed of learning. Measures which reflect individual performance improve the quality and speed of performance. Henry Triesler&#39;s measure for the productivity of his machinists, the TV monitor at Federal Express which flashes the day&#39;s volume of parcels, the list in the customer service department which reports the average speed of response to in-coming calls, and the list of sales by sales people on the bathroom wall are examples of energizing measures. If the measures are directly linked to compensation, they can be even more powerful. Any work becomes more lively, when objective measures are introduced for evaluating it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Take active interest in the promotion and progress of your subordinates</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is self-explanatory, but not very common.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Focus on work, not the person or the position</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In any group work situation, we are conscious that someone is the boss and others are subordinates, someone is the &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;authority&quot; and others are not. Eliminating that distinction from thought, speech and action has a very energizing impact on the group. That is why participatory management is so effective.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SPLITTING SECONDS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">John Banks, CEO of Audio Centre in Montreal, understands the power of the individual act. When a new phone operator was recruited, John spends one full day sitting with her and listening to how she answered the phone. After each call, he told her how her words and tone of voice made him feel. His theme to the operator was, &quot;I spend a fortune on advertising and what do the customers get? They get you! Energize every word you speak with a smile in your voice.&quot; When a new accountant joined the firm, Banks asked him to spend two weeks out on the sales floor, so he would become sensitive to the needs and feelings of the customers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Banks is equally concerned about the smallest word and gesture of his sales force. When the store is busy and all the sales people are engaged with customers, he still expects one of them to rush over to greet each new customer who walks in the door and promise them attention at the earliest possible moment. In his training sessions, John focuses on understanding exactly how the customer feels, the doubt, distrust and anxiety that are inherent in the relationship of customer to sales person and the importance of tiny gestures, such as failing to make eye contact for a few second when the customer is speaking. &quot;I have tried through 547 morning meetings to stimulate our sales people&#39;s compassion for the typically confused or intimidated customer. This constant effort has energized our client relationships and has been responsible for a great part of our growth,&quot; he says.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">John says: &quot;There are no miracles in this business. It all comes down to simple acts. Never having a dirty ashtray. Never walking past a piece of fluff on the carpet. My biggest challenge is to energize my managers, so they will energize their people.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Every single small act has a significance to the overall result</span><span class="c3">.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Just exactly how small an act does John refer to? &quot;I tell my staff that if two sales people are talking when a customer walks in the door, they should end the conversation right in the middle of the sentence and directly attend on the customer. I tell them, &quot;Don&#39;t even wait to finish the joke.&#39; The customer is so sensitive. Split seconds make the difference. We have been able to split seconds here.&quot; It is no wonder that Bank&#39;s business has grown five-fold over the last five years, from $2 million in 1984 to $10.5 million in 1988.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">INSTITUTIONALIZING THE ACT</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Every act performed in a company can be energized by any individual through one or more of the fifteen methods described above. Each energized act infuses fresh energy into the organization and makes work more alive and enjoyable. People begin to think, feel and respond differently. Employees come to work with a different attitude. Customers approach the company with new expectations. The contagion of freshness spreads to other people and other acts, until it becomes a culture or way of life within the company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Such a spontaneous process can flower and spread by itself up to a point. But often it will stop at the boundaries of one department or one level of the company. The process can be facilitated, accelerated and extended throughout the company by institutionalizing it at four different levels. The higher level methods release greater energy and freshness, but they depend to a great extent on the personal understanding and attitude of each individual who employs them. The lower level methods are less powerful and effective, but they are much easier to extend to many people and many acts. Any company striving to energize itself from below will find that all the methods are useful.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Awareness</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The highest and most powerful way to energize an act is by being aware at a higher or wider level. John Banks is aware of how his customers&#39; feel. Therefore he knows precisely how to behave so as to make them feel most comfortable. Nedlloyd&#39;s Rick de Rooy is aware of how energizing it can be to learn a new skill, therefore he could transform Dave Gray from a troublesome employee into an energized one. Fred Smith is conscious of the enormous untapped potentials for his company, so he speaks with conviction when he challenges his people to be the very best. Lee Southard of Vipont really believes it when he says: &quot;You can be whatever you resolve to be. Everything is possible!&quot; This awareness itself is ultimately energizing.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Attitude</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">It is not always possible to make every employee, especially in larger companies, fully share the awareness of how an act can be energized. Therefore, the same act can be energized by teaching people an expansive attitude. Banks teaches his sales people to empathize with the customer. C.E. Woolman taught Delta employees the attitude of thinking from the customer&#39;s point of view. AMRE&#39;s Dennie Brown teaches his accounting staff the importance of a positive attitude when handling money.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Rules</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Attitudes are psychological. Not every person can take the right attitude all the time. But it is always possible to follow a rule and train people to follow it. That is why P.A.M. has specific rules about how dispatchers should conduct themselves over the phone with drivers and what they should do if the driver has a problem. We often think of rules as something cold and impersonal, but that is only because they are usually framed that way. Federal Express has framed rules that state exactly what the rights of an employee are in situations where they feel they are being treated unfairly, including the right of personal appeal to the CEO. Such rules have a powerful energizing influence on the way both managers and employees conduct themselves.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instructions</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">At the lowest level, it is possible to add an energizing element to a small act, even when the person carrying out the act is not aware of the purpose and lacks a higher attitude, by giving precise instructions as to how the act is to be performed. This is how Mayflower energizes the act of knocking at the door. Perhaps the company cannot teach psychology to every mover it employs, but it can give specific instructions which will go a long way to improving customer satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">UNFORGETTABLE MOMENTS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">C.E. Woolman was a simple man of great personal warmth, who won an endearing loyalty from his people, yet was forever urging them on to higher performance. Woolman was a man of many values, but two-which in many companies oppose one another-stood out most prominently: his respect for people and his thriftiness. He had the open friendliness of a farmer and the frugality produced by the Great Depression. There are many stories recounted at Delta about this legendary man. One in particular illustrates just how powerfully a single, small act can energize a whole company.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A young man was posted on the night shift at Delta&#39;s airport repair hanger, where planes are serviced for the next day&#39;s flights. He was responsible for managing the spare parts room and providing parts to the technicians working on the planes. Usually most of his work occurred early in the night, when the maintenance process was beginning. So he sometimes found there were long hours with nothing to do. On one such occasion, the young man fell asleep at his desk, for how long he did not know. Then suddenly he was aroused by a most uncomfortable feeling and immediately realized that there was someone standing in front of him in the room. As he raised his head and glanced up at that man&#39;s face, his worst fears were confirmed. It was C.E. Woolman. Woolman looked down at the man with an expressionless face, paused for a few moments, and then said: &quot;Young man, if you are going to sleep on the job, the very least you can do is turn out the lights!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This unforgettable story, told by the young man with humor and affection to everyone he met and retold by them countless times to thousands of other employees, friends and customers, is the epitome of an energized act. In a split second Woolman had reinforced two of his most precious and apparently contradictory values-cost consciousness and his commitment to his people. This story and many others like it loom large in the minds of Delta employees when they speak to customers on the phone, when flight attendants share their own sandwiches with hungry customers on late night flights, and when managers discover the errors made by their subordinates. And each time they recall or recount these stories, they release more energy and add a little more freshness to their work.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">ENERGIZING EVERY ACT</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There are rare, wonderful moments in life, when you feel totally alive and fresh and joyous, when you really believe that anything and everything is possible. At such moments you are fully alert, fully confident, overflowing with energy. And very often at such times, the thought occurs. &quot;If only this could last. If only I could feel this way always. Life would be unbelievable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The highest and greatest goal a company can strive to achieve is not to double or triple its profits or revenues. It is not to become the largest or best of its kind in the country or even in the world. The very highest aspiration a company can have is to fill its every working day with unforgettable moments like these, so that every employee and every act is overflowing with energy and constantly growing as far and as high as they can. Such a company need not even think about doubling, because it will double every year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Any company can employ three different strategies to double revenues and/or profits in 24 months.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Partial strategies tap the potentials of one or two components or values for dramatic short-term results.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Comprehensive strategies grow all the components and create a dynamic equilibrium between them by energizing all stages of the energy conversion process through value implementation. This strategy acts from above downward to achieve long-term growth and high profitability.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c8">* Energizing every act is a strategy that begins at the bottom at isolated points and spreads outward and upward until it transforms the entire company into a vibrant living organization that can expand without limit.</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Notes:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">25. </span><span class="c3">&quot;Can Ford Stay On Top?&quot;, Business Week, September 28, 1987, p.81.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">26 &quot;Ford&#39;s Idea Machine,&quot; Newsweek, November 24, 1986, p.65.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">27. ibid., p. 66.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">28. &quot;Old-Line Industry Shapes Up,&quot; Fortune, April 27, 1987, p. 23.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gi03dm4rmv1"><span class="c3">29. &quot;Ford&#39;s Idea Machine,&quot; p. 66.</span></p><h1 class="c21"><span>Checklist https://docs.google.com/document/d/11IV_XAMu32PWMjCoeCaopPEpvQkC6T8sHO0s8L94uGA/edit?usp=sharing</span><span class="c1">Chapter 15 PLANNING FOR PROFIT</span></h1><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We move now from idea and example to application in your company. But perhaps there is one last lingering doubt to be answered. In spite of our explanations and illustrations, some readers may still be wondering what all our ethereal talk about energy has to do with doubling the profits of your company. This raises a very fundamental question which is rarely ever asked: Where does profit come from?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Let us dispense with metaphysics and talk practically. What exactly is the difference between a company that makes money and a company that loses money? What, for instance, was the difference between the Chrysler Corporation that lost $3.3 billion between 1978 and 1981 and the Chrysler Corporation that earned $3.3 billion between 1982 and 1984? Think about it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">There is no single answer to these questions. There are many sources of profit, many factors that generate it, many differences between the profitable and unprofitable business. But all the answers follow a pattern and conform to the central process described in this book.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">High Energy</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Without energy there is no work, no profit. The higher the energy, the greater the profit. Eduardo Malone stirred up the energies at Chargeurs and profits multiplied eight-fold in two years. Ben Thompson-McCausland dramatically increased the energy level at London Life. New premium income grew 87.5% the first year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">High Values</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Without values, work is substandard. The higher the values that are actually achieved in physical work, the greater the financial results. Jan Carlzon significantly improved customer service and punctuality at SAS and profits soared by $80 million in one year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Clear Objectives</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Work becomes efficient only when the objectives are clear to everyone. Harold Corner set clear objectives to cut delivery time on his molds in half and cut costs so C &amp; J Industries could compete with the Japanese. Those objectives mobilized his whole company to a united effort that reduced the operating costs of C &amp; J by more than $500,000.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right Structure</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Profits are generated by good organization. Good organization is based on right structure. Putting in the right structure enabled Marty Wiegel to raise the profits of Wiegel Tool Works 40% in one year.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right Systems</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Systems are the foundation of efficient operations, and they can always be made better. The addition of a 13 digit code to P.A.M.&#39;s computerized dispatch system improves the utilization of equipment, drivers&#39; time, and service to customers and will save the company up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The measurement system Triesler developed at Precision Grinding for monitoring the productivity of his machine operators helped raise the shop rate (measured in revenues per employee per hour) by 40% and convert operating income from a 11% loss into a 12% profit.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good Coordination</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Unless activities and systems within the company are well-coordinated, profit just falls through the gaps. Improving coordination enabled Bang &amp; Olufsen&#39;s machine shops to increase productivity by 25% and East Asiatic Company&#39;s timber division to raise profits by 30% a year for three successive years.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Good Communication</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Communication between people, departments and levels of the company and between the company and its vendors and customers is a large part of what being in business is all about. Communication is the very essence of teamwork. Every breakdown in communication affects the bottom line as directly as a breakdown on the assembly line. Improved communication was a driving force for the 25% increase in revenues and profits in one year at Elizabeth Carbide, the 5.5 fold growth of J &amp; M Incorporated over the last three years, and the amazing profit performance of Ford Motors over the last half decade.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Higher Education</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Education has made this nation the most prosperous in the world. It has made IBM the most profitable company in the world too. Education improves the quality of every idea a company generates, every decision it makes, and every action it takes. Better ideas, better decisions and better actions mean better profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Better Skills</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Virtually every time an employee handles a product, processes a piece of paper and interacts with a customer, that person has an impact on the profits of your business. A minute difference in skills can make the difference between a perfect $25,000 die and a useless hunk of steel, between a life-long customer and a life-long enemy. Motorola calculated it achieved a 3000% return on its investment in training. Better physical, technical, organizational, interpersonal, managerial and psychological skills generate more profits on every corporate activity.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Figure 5 depicts the process of energy conversion and illustrates how each of these factors acts to increase the generation, transmission and conversion of energy into results. Each factor acts as one of the three lenses to energize the corporation by improving the concentration and magnification of energy as it flows through the system. The end result of this process is higher productivity, higher revenues and higher profits.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">CHOOSING YOUR GOAL</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">In the preceding chapters we have presented elaborate explanations and many examples of the process of corporate growth and how it can be consciously utilized by your company for rapid growth of revenues and profits. Explanations can be interesting, but they rarely inspire us to action. Examples can fill us with admiration for those that have accomplished great things, but they seldom prompt us to follow in the footsteps of those we admire.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">What then can inspire us to take the practical steps needed for high achievement? For that, we need an inspiring practical goal and a practical plan of action.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Choose a goal for the growth in revenues and profits of your company over the next two years, or if you have already done so earlier, review that goal now. Choosing the right goal is of utmost importance. A practical goal is one which you can and will achieve. It must be sufficiently challenging to release your energies for action, and yet not so high as to seem unachievable. If you choose a goal which you fully know you can achieve, it does not inspire, it does not release and mobilize your energies for action. After some time, interest wanes. The goal and the effort are forgotten. If, on the other hand, in a moment of boldness or enthusiasm you fix a goal a little beyond your maximum capacities to achieve, after a while doubt and skepticism creep into the mind. In the light of common day, the goal looks impossible. It ceases to inspire and energize you to action. Or if you chose a goal which mentally you know is achievable, but which demands an effort you are unwilling to make to attain it, after a few halting efforts the goal will be forgotten and the effort abandoned.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Therefore choosing wisely in the first place is of the greatest importance. The best way to choose a goal that will work for you is to review all the characteristics of your company and compare them with the characteristics of high performance companies which you have read about, heard about and know from first hand experience. Weigh the relative strengths and weaknesses of your company in comparison with these other companies. Consider how far your company has come and the capacities needed to accomplish what they have accomplished. Now think of a goal for your company which you can feel enthusiastic about. It should be a goal that your feel a physical urge to accomplish. That is the best goal for your company-not a dollar more or less.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 290.93px; height: 349.87px;"><img alt="Corporate Energy conversion" src="images/image9.png" style="width: 290.93px; height: 349.87px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Figure 5.

We have also identified a large number of strategies which your company, your division or your department can employ to convert the five components into engines of growth and to intensify and accelerate the process of converting energy into results. These exercises can assist you in formulating a goal that is at once challenging and realistic.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you have completed these exercises, pause at this time to review your responses to them and assess their cumulative significance. The following exercise asks you to review the original goals you set at the end of Chapter One and the subsequent plans you have developed in response to the questions we have raised in order to see whether your original goals still seem challenging and realistic. Since several of your action plans may contain duplication and since it may not be possible to carry out all the plans simultaneously, a provision is made to adjust your goals taking into account these factors.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Use the Profit Plan form in appendix B to record your answers to the questions listed below:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">1. Review the original revenue and profit goals which you entered in the Profit Plan line 1. Are they sufficiently challenging? Are they realistic? If not, modify them and enter the revised goals in line 2.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">2. If you have not already done so, enter base line data for the current year&#39;s revenues and profits on Line 3 of the Profit Plan.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">3. Review your assessment of the five components in the questionnaire at the end of Chapter Two and the action plan for the five components referred to at the end of Chapter Three. What impact will these actions have on the revenues and profits of your business?

Our aim is to accelerate the natural, unconscious process by which companies growth by consciously initiating actions that will accelerate that process. That requires imagination, forethought and careful planning.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Many companies prepare strategic plans to develop new opportunities in the marketplace, financial plans for investment of capital, production or sales plans. But that type of planning is inadequate for this purpose. Plans which focus only on one or two of the five components often fail, because the other components are not developed enough to support the growth. When Trimedyne&#39;s sales exploded in 1987, its production capacity was inadequate to meet the demand, it was severely under-staffed and under-managed, and it lacked the organizational structure and systems necessary to handle the expansion. That is why AMRE plans far ahead for its human resources and systems requirements as well as its sales strategy and financial needs.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">A very powerful method to clarify your understanding of the steps needed in order to achieve your goals is to envision what the company will look like when these goals have been achieved. Federal Express conducts exercises like this in order to help it anticipate its future needs and develop sound plans for meeting them. Recently the company undertook an exercise called Butterfly 2000 to help it envision what the company will be like when it achieves its corporate goal of increasing the number of packages it handles every day from the current 1 million to six million. Through this exercise management identified the resources it will require in each of the five components and the strategies it will employ to develop them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Smith explains the concept: &quot;Planning for the future is very difficult when an organization is this complex and this capital intensive, and the size and scope is really very large. What I have done periodically is to create a snap shot vision of some point in the future, a vision of the future. The important point is that we thought about what the company was going to look like at some point in the future and then we worked backward to the present. We did not extrapolate forward from the present to the future.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">This exercise enabled Federal Express to project how many parcels or tons of freight they will be transporting, how many people, planes and trucks they will need to carry that freight, how many hubs and sorting facilities will be required and where they should be located, what type of service facilities will be needed to handle all those planes and trucks, etc. But the exercise goes beyond this. It also enabled them to identify the type of organization the company will need in order to manage this size business, how many phone calls it will have to handle every day, how many invoices, how much information, what type of systems it will need in order to handle these large volumes efficiently, how many seasoned managers, pilots, engineers, drivers, couriers, and customer service agents it will need for its worldwide operations, how it will attract them, and how it will train them in the Federal Express way of doing business.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Jim Barksdale talked about planning at Federal Express:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c18 c6 c17 c8">&quot;We do a lot of planning in this company. We have to plan. That keeps us from making enormously expensive mistakes. It also enables us not to get overwhelmed by the stress of growth, because we know what is coming.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THINK DOUBLE</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Imagine your company/your division/your department twice as large and twice as profitable as it is today. Or if the goals you have chosen will more than double revenues and profits, think of how the company will be when it achieves these goals. Ask yourself, what does doubling really mean? What does it involve? How will things be different than they are now?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Think about the impact of doubling on each of the five components of the business. There are several different ways or levels at which it can be done? First start by visualizing the physical results of such an expansion. How many customers will you have when you achieve the goals? How many products or services will the company be producing and delivering? How large a facility will be required? How many stores, offices, plants? What new or additional equipment will be required? How much additional investment will be needed in plant and machinery, in raw materials and finished inventory? How many people will be necessary to produce and market these products and services?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Now take a second look from a slightly different angle. What is the knowledge and skill necessary to accomplish your goal? Will it require greater sales and marketing expertise? Will it require greater design capabilities or production know-how? Will your employees need better technical, organizational or operational skills? Do your managers have all the skills they will need to make decisions, solve problems, plan and direct new activities, motivate and communicate with their employees and customers?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Third, try to imagine how all these people will function together within the organization? Who will train the new people and upgrade the skills of existing employees? What new departments will have to be added? What new positions will be needed at the level of operators, supervisors and managers in sales, marketing, finance, production, administration, etc.? Do you have the systems needed to handle the larger volume and complexity of work-systems for recruitment, training, production, quality control, customer service, financial control, reporting, decision-making, etc.? How will the company ensure good communication and proper coordination of activities as the organization expands?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fourth, look at the ideas which direct the activities of the company. Does the company have a clear mission statement to guide its future growth? What type of company does it want to become? What are its values? Does it have clear quantitative goals or objectives? What type of plan is needed to build up each of the five components in order to achieve those goals?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Fifth, look at the force that will be needed to accomplish the goal you have set. Who will provide the energy for all this work of planning, directing, and monitoring progress? Of building up each of the five components to the required level? Of attracting new customers, creating new products, raising capital, building up the organization and developing the people? How much energy and effort will it require? Where will it come from?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Finally, look into yourself. What skills and capacities will you need in order to accomplish the goals? How much personal effort and dedication will it require? How do you feel about pursuing the goals you have set and the plans you have drawn up? Are you inspired, enthused, excited and overflowing with energy? Pause here and reaffirm your decision and commitment to the goals. The surest sign of your future success is if you can feel at this point a calm, happy solid aspiration to take up the challenge and grow yourself and your company as far and as high as possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Take the time to develop a vision of your company in the future at the six levels described above. Set down your vision on paper in as much detail as possible. Discuss it with your associates. Work out the alternatives in your mind, until your vision becomes so real that it seems like you can almost see into the future.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">FROM PLAN TO IMPLEMENTATION</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Once you have established the goals for your company / division / department and developed a clear vision of what it should become, follow these steps to translate your vision into reality:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">1. Create a full awareness within the company, at least at the higher levels and preferably at all levels, of the opportunities that exist for doubling both externally and within each of the five components.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">2. Strive to communicate your knowledge and conviction to create a consensus among your people for achieving the goals you have established.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">3. Get people actively involved in identifying opportunities and contributing their ideas of how the company can achieve these goals.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">4. In collaboration with your management team, draw up a detailed plan of action for the next two years to achieve the goals.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">5. Ask each executive in the company in collaboration with his managers to work out detailed plans for the development of each of the five components of the company in order to meet the requirements of the plan.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">6. Ask each manager to study the major activities under his or her responsibility and identify the precise requirements in terms of personnel, systems, space, equipment, finance, knowledge, skills, etc. to fully implement the plan.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">7. Impart an understanding of the plan to all your people and win their enthusiastic support for implementing it.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">8. Implement the plan. Even if you carry out only 50% of what you propose, your results will surely double.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">9. Along with these other efforts, try to energize as many acts in the company as possible. This will generate a very positive and supportive climate for achieving your goals.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">THE THREE CONCLUSIONS</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We ended the first chapter by presenting three fundamental conclusions about rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our first conclusion stated that rapid, sustained and profitable growth is possible for any company that really wants it and is willing to make the effort. Through the explanations and examples in this book, we have shown why and how we believe this statement to be true. We have particularly emphasized the central importance of the human aspiration in the process of corporate growth. To achieve the maximum possible in the life of your company and in your own life, you must feel something like Trimedyne&#39;s Howard Cooper. &quot;I am impatient for success,&quot; he says. &quot;It is my burning expectation to get there, my aspiration...It is a very strong dream I have. I have to tell you that I dream this stuff.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our second conclusion states that rapid growth in revenues and profits is the result of a process, a process that can be learned. Many entrepreneurs may be born with innate talents for enterprise, but the knowledge and skills needed to grow and keep growing a company can be acquired by anyone. We have attempted to describe this process as clearly and fully as possible in a book intended for the general business reader and for companies ranging in size from $100,000 dollars to $100 billion. This process is not a theory or construction. It is a description of the dynamics we have observed in hundreds of companies of all sizes and in a wide variety of businesses. The process is naturally occurring in every company all the time. Our aim is to make that natural process more conscious and, therefore, more precise, swift, powerful and effective. We have cited many examples to show that a conscious utilization of the process can dramatically accelerate the pace of growth and multiply its results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our third conclusion states that the process of growth is fundamentally the same for the individual, the company, and the nation. In fact the three are inextricably intertwined, i.e. personal growth, corporate growth and national growth go together. At many points in the book, we have attempted to show the direct and intimate relationship between the growth of individuals within a company and the growth of the company itself. The parallel goes even deeper, because personal growth of any type within or outside the company involves the same process of releasing, directing and harnessing energy to achieve results.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">DOUBLE AMERICA</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">We have said very little about the relationship between the growth of companies and the growth of the nation as a whole, but here too the connection is direct and very close. Nations grow through the growth of individuals and organizations. All the achievements of the U.S. economy thus far are the cumulative result of countless individual and corporate contributions. Yet at the same time, these individual and corporate achievements are made possible by the general atmosphere and supporting commercial climate in the country as a whole.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">Today the American national climate</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">permits</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">companies to grow and to double. It does not actively</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">support</span><span class="c4 c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">them. Companies that choose as their goals to double or triple revenues and profits are pioneers and trend-setters serving the nation as a whole. Their example can be a source of inspiration for thousands of other companies to follow, the way today&#39;s great corporations have inspired countless others to emulate them.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">But imagine what could be achieved, if the nation as a whole adopted the objective of doubling as its inspiring goal and offered social recognition and support to any and every company that consents to serve that goal by doubling their own business. Suppose that instead of looking with indifference or concern on the growth of other companies, we viewed their success as our own achievement at the national level. We could create a national environment that actively fosters the unlimited growth of its members and its own endless expansion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Today our country is preoccupied by national economic problems-the trade deficit, the national debt, inflation and unemployment. But if the productivity and profitability of American industry doubled, all those problems would disappear. If a company like Chrysler Corporation could covert horrendous losses into tremendous profits and eradicate its enormous pile of debts seven years before they were due for repayment, why cannot our country do it too? The scale is different, but the process is exactly the same.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The process is the one described in this book. At the national level it requires the releasing of some of the enormous, pent-up, latent potentials of this young and vibrant nation and a restoration of the balance between the essential components of national development. This is a country that ABOUNDS in energy and resourcefulness. We have seen what this nation could accomplish when faced with the challenge of saving freedom and democracy in the last world war. If even a portion of these capacities were released and channeled for national prosperity, this country could feed and cloth all its members and have enough left over to feed and cloth the entire rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">To double revenues and profits is a fitting short term goal for a company. To double the prosperity of our nation, to</span><span class="c6 c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">double America</span><span class="c3">, is a fitting collective goal for a people with the energy and potential we possess.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">SUMMARY</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Profit is the direct result of high energy, commitment to values, clear objectives, right structure and systems, good communication and coordination, higher education and better skills.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Choosing the right goal, which is at once challenging and realistic, is critically important for doubling.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Envisioning how the company will be when it achieves the goal generates knowledge of all that needs to be done to achieve it at six different levels.</span></p><p class="c0 c2 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* The goal takes on life when it is converted into a practical profit plan, which identifies the steps to be taken to energize the five components and the anticipated results of that effort.</span></p><p class="c0 c7 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3">* Begin with the challenge of doubling your company. Then accept the challenge of Doubling America.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>

American companies, your list would include AT&amp;T, Coco-Cola, Delta Air Lines, General Mills, IBM, Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and a handful of others. More than ten years ago, Fred Harmon and Garry Jacobs began to ask what it was that made these companies stand out, and why they&#39;ve been able to sustain their success over so many years and against such stiff competition. As the result of a search that involved personal interviews with key employees from a wide mix of companies, the authors found some stimulating, thought-provoking answers. The Vital Difference reveals those answers to you.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c3">This book has also been published in Danish, French, German, Japanese, Portugese and Spanish.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c9">&quot;Fred Harmon and Garry Jacobs have done a rare and superb job of unearthing both the &#39;soft&#39; and &#39;hard&#39; factors that underpin sustained corporate success&quot;.</span><span class="c14">&nbsp;- Tom Peters, Coauthor In Search of Excellence </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c9">&quot;Fred Harmon and Garry Jacobs have managed to write a book that is easy- indeed captivating- reading full of profound insight, indeed wisdom.

So unusual is this phenomenon that when it does occur, we tend to look upon it in awe and admiration rather than closely scrutinizing its origins and history for a clue to the process. In fact, we are so sure that this high achievement is the result of some exceptional talent or extraordinary luck that we rarely even ask the most fundamental question: &quot;What is the process by which sustained corporate success is achieved?&quot; Some may even wonder whether there actually is a process at all. But science assures us that there is a process behind all phenomena&mdash;physical, social, psychological, and even spiritual.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This question that we have asked first is actually the last that can be answered. Before we ask how an organization grows, and grows continuously, we must ask several other questions. If organizations grow, there must be an energy or force that drives that growth. What is that energy? Where does it come from? How is it converted into achievement? How does it generate growth?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our search for answers to these questions spanned more than a decade and literally circled the globe. Drawing inspiration from such diverse sources as the philosophy of Indian yoga, the process of social development, and the psychology of personality, we caught a glimpse of a wider vision, arrived at a hypothesis, and applied it to a study of some of America&rsquo;s most successful corporations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our aim was to trace the historical development of these companies from their early days, to identify the most prominent factors, both internal and external, responsible for their growth, and at the same time to examine each of these companies at different levels from top to bottom and in cross section of their activities in order to identify characteristics common to the entire organization. Our work involved an extensive research of literature and more than 100 interviews in 15 leading companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The first and probably the most important of our findings is the all-pervasive role of human energy in the development of individuals, companies, and societies. We observed that this energy is converted by successful corporations into an atmosphere of intensity, which other companies lack. We have sought to discover the origins of that energy and the process of its conversion into intensity for a clue to the secret of enduring success.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The generation and conversion of energy is the key to corporate development. But who or what accomplishes this great transformation? In answering this question, we have to introduce the reader to the most important personality in the life of any company&mdash;the personality of the corporation itself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Personality</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a comprehensive term that includes several component parts. We found that the parallel between the individual and the company is far more than a metaphor. It contains a deeper truth. All the pieces of the corporate puzzle began to fall into place, and a pattern of interrelationships emerged. Values, organization, people, systems, skills, technology, machines, materials, and money are not isolated components; they are parts of an integrated, living whole&mdash;a personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Each of these parts contains a vast reserve of untapped energies and potentials, which the corporate personality releases and utilizes for its growth. We are all familiar with the power of money and technology, so much so that we easily overlook other powers of the corporate personality that contain equal or greater potentials. Henry Ford started with $28,000 and tapped one of these powers to fuel a 25,000-fold expansion of his company in 25 years, without any additional investment. J. Willard Marriott and his son exploited another of these powers to convert a few small drive-in restaurants into the eighth largest U.S.-based hotel chain in the world. A considerable portion of this book is devoted to exploring the rich creative potentials of the powers of corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is very easy to get lost in admiration of one or two powers of the corporate personality and lose sight of the whole, of which they form only a part. But much of the power of organization results from the interrelationships between these parts, the golden gaps that have to be bridged to combine them into a single, unified whole. Merck &amp; Company, Inc. rose from sixth place to first in the American pharmaceuticals industry by bridging the gap between research and marketing. C. E. Woolman&mdash;a simple, friendly, lovable man&mdash;transformed Delta Air Lines, Inc. from a crop-dusting operation into the world&rsquo;s most profitable airline by building bridges between people. We have tried to focus in on these organizational interrelationships and illustrate how they have been built up by successful corporations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The whole we have been describing is itself a part of a greater whole. The living organization is a child of society. The difference between the individual and the company is that people grow by becoming independent of their parents, while corporations grow by forging a more intimate relationship and interdependence with the society that fostered them. A stationmaster who recognized this truth 100 years ago founded what is today the largest retail operation in the world, Sears, Roebuck and Company. Tomas Bata, an uneducated shoemaker who discovered it, expanded his company 15-fold in 5 years and built it up into the largest shoe manufacturer in the world. A couple of young computer buffs made it the springboard for the 1,500-fold growth of Apple Computers, Inc. in a period of 8 years. Shy, inarticulate Robert Woodruff used it to build up The Coca-Cola Company into the most articulate marketing organization and the most popular soft drink in the whole world. Later in the book we explore some of the infinite potentials of this perpetual child-parent relationship.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Finally we come to the process that leads to enduring success. It is the process by which personality develops. We have sought to discover and explain the intimate relationship between the growth of individual personality and the development of the corporation and show how both are expressions of the same process. By consciously following this process, any manager can become a significant individual in the life of the organization, and any company can energize itself and embark on a course that leads to endless expansion and enduring success.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.7kz9h6b442ao"><span class="c3">For those who seek the ultimate boon of endless corporate expansion, we invite you to that great adventure and to share our glimpse of a vision of the process. For those who seek a more limited boon like doubling your profits or sales, the book presents specific strategies for achieving your goal.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 1 - The Driving Force</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When we arrived at the headquarters of Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, California, to begin our initial round of interviews, we were struck by the intense energy that seemed to supercharge the atmosphere. Evidently we were not the only ones to perceive it. For when we began our very first interview with Intel&rsquo;s manager of corporate communications, Jim Jarrett, his very first word in reply to our opening question was </span><span class="c2">energy</span><span class="c3">. What did he first notice when he joined Intel? &quot;Energy. Energy is certainly one of the striking characteristics of this company and this industry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Nor were Jim Jarrett and Intel unique in this respect. In fact, our experience at Intel was repeated over and over again as we visited a cross section of highly successful companies around the United States. From Silicon Valley to Atlanta, from companies barely a decade old like Apple to centenarians like Coca-Cola, from breakfast foods to life insurance, wherever we found high achievement, we found high energy, too. &quot;There is an energy here. Everybody feels it,&quot; declared Doug MacMaster, president of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, the nation&rsquo;s largest manufacturer of prescription drugs. There is &quot;a kinetic energy that flows through all of us,&quot; said Jere Whiteley of Northwestern Mutual, America&rsquo;s most admired life insurance company.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Energetic People</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is this thing that is so tangible and palpable to the experience of these companies and yet does not find even the slightest mention in textbooks or university courses on management? Energy is basic to all life. Wherever there is greatness, great energy abounds. Many who have been in the presence of a great personality ha0ve noted the aura of intensity such an individual radiates, the unbounded and overflowing energy of a Napoleon, a Churchill, a Beethoven, a Carnegie, or a Henry Ford. After meeting Theodore Roosevelt, an Englishman once remarked, &quot;Do you know the two most wonderful things I have seen in your country? Niagara Falls and the President of the United States, both great wonders of </span><a id="id.1iqoiy77hwsj"></a><span class="c3">nature!&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><a id="id.6c1tbqw983ac"></a><span class="c3">One writer described Roosevelt as &quot;a perpetual flow of torrential energy, a sense of motion even in stillness ... thrilling to be near.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><a id="id.1pr21glb0r2w"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy is the basis of all creativity. It is the fuel that feeds the fire of inspiration. Honor&eacute; de Balzac, one of the greatest French writers, possessed a vitality as imposing and fascinating as the life depicted in his stories. &quot;Everything he did seemed to have a tenfold intensity. When he laughed the pictures on the walls trembled; when he spoke the words came cascading forth; ...when he worked there was no difference between day and night as he sat writing round the clock and blunted a dozen pens in the process.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Balzac was a firm believer in the store of energy concentrated inside people, and his life gave credence to his belief. During 1830 and 1831 he poured out approximately 150 short novels, stories, articles, and commentaries&mdash;a feat unparalleled in the annals of literature&mdash;and over the next 20 years, he completed 40 full-length novels.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy spurs innovation. No other individual has been responsible for striking the springs of so much wealth as Thomas Alva Edison. Edison was an indomitable worker who frequently went days on end without sleep in the process of producing 1,100 patentable inventions and giving birth to several entirely new industries&mdash;the motion picture, phonograph and recording, and electric and household appliance industries. The General Electric Company, which Edison founded, is today the tenth largest industrial corporation in the United States, with $23 billion in assets. In 1907, when Edison was 60, Hearst&rsquo;s </span><span class="c2">Cosmopolitan</span><a id="id.e1bf6jkkjwev"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;magazine urged him to authorize a serialized autobiography. &quot;When I go into senile decay I may consider the autobiographical scheme,&quot; Edison replied, &quot;but as long as I can put in eighteen hours daily, I don&rsquo;t want to waste any time on it.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Energetic Entrepreneurs</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Business leaders, especially those who have created great enterprises within a single lifetime, are also noted for their energy. In 1940 a psychology student named Mort Feinberg went into an IBM office in Manhattan to process some punch cards for his Ph.D. thesis. A fairly old gentleman came over to offer his assistance. Feinberg was struck by &quot;the tremendous energy, the tremendous strength exuded by the guy.&quot; It was Thomas Watson, Sr., the founder of the International Business Machines Corporation. Feinberg&rsquo;s description was identical to the one given by </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;magazine in an article published the same year. John C. Johnston, the founder of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, was known as a man of boundless energy who migrated from the East Coast to the frontiers of Wisconsin and set up the first life insurance company west of New England in 1857.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most of these leaders channeled their high energy into endless hours of hard work. When J. Willard Marriott opened a small A &amp; W Root Beer stand on a busy street in Washington, D.C., in 1927, he was launching the billion-dollar Marriott Corporation. Biographer Robert O&rsquo;Brien described Marriott in his early days:</span></p><a id="id.fcns0ogmee5e"></a><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">His managers never knew what time of day or night he&rsquo;d show up at the kitchen door and go bird-dogging almost at a half-run through the kitchen, the pantries, the storage rooms, the refrigerators, the restaurant itself, running a finger over the shelves to check for dust, checking under tables and in cutlery drawers, checking the ranges, the storage rooms, the trays about to be served, sampling the root beer, and raising hell if everything wasn&rsquo;t spotless, neat, clean, bright, polished, done efficiently, done well.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sometimes an enterprise has received its greatest impetus not from the founder, but from energetic people who came afterward, like Julius Rosenwald and General Robert Wood at Sears. Wood, who inspired and directed Sears&rsquo; entry into the retail store business in the 1920s, was a tower of strength with a military bearing and a sparkle in his eye. Donald Craib, chairman of Allstate Insurance Company, whose father was a close friend of the general, says Wood was an energetic man who exuded confidence. &quot;You knew you were in the presence of a man who could wield considerable power.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy is not the exclusive possession of the great. It is an attribute shared by most successful CEOs who have made a significant impact on the companies they directed. In fact, we all have times when our energies and productivity are far higher than normal. Often this occurs when we are faced with a difficult problem that must be overcome or an extraordinary opportunity that calls for an all-out effort. High achievers are set apart from the rest by the way they use the energy available to them. Mort Feinberg, who is now professor of industrial psychology at New York University as well as consultant and confidant to some of America&rsquo;s leading executives, says that energy is an &quot;enormously important&quot; factor in their success, but not energy alone. &quot;With the energy comes discipline. These men have a tendency to be highly disciplined. They are not out to parties. They go to sleep on time. They rarely drink. Very few of them smoke. They exercise regularly. They are very disciplined people. Their energies are focused.&quot; These individuals are able to accomplish more than the average because they channel all their available energies into activities designed to achieve the goals they have set for themselves instead of allowing that energy to flow in many different and unconnected directions not governed by a clear central focus. Not only is their energy more disciplined and focused, it is also more constant and consistent&mdash;because it is not expended in an extravagant or wasteful fashion on unproductive activities. As a result, highly disciplined and intensely focused energy becomes a characteristic of all that they do. It becomes a conspicuous mark, a presence that can be felt by those around them.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Intensity</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In some fashion the energy of an individual can be transferred to the organizations he or she founds and become a characteristic of the company as well. One of the most important findings of the McKinsey study of America&rsquo;s best-managed enterprises reported by Peters and Waterman in their book </span><span class="c2">In Search of Excellence</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was the presence of a palpable intensity in the companies they studied. The authors noted that they could &quot;feel it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our own experience has been much the same. In company after company we were struck by the intensity of the atmosphere we found. It was not just the energy of countless individuals, but a solid mass of radiant power that seemed to pervade the entire organization, supporting and energizing its individual members at least as much as it was supported and energized by them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But in each company this intensity had a different quality. As Feinberg says, &quot;There is a big difference in the energy of different organizations.&quot; At Intel we found the energy disciplined and tense. At Apple it was buoyant youthful enthusiasm. At General Mills, Inc. there was a dynamic exuberance. At Merck it felt like the controlled power of a well-oiled machine. At Coca-Cola it had vibrancy and charm. At Delta it was the intense warmth of a close-knit family. At North-western Mutual it was a smooth, quiet hum, yet very active and alert.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Not only does the quality of the energy differ from company to company, but so does the quantity and what one might call the stability of intensity it produces. In Apple and Intel one had the feeling of a young and as yet unstable foundation that had to be maintained by a conscious effort and constant straining. By contrast, at Delta and Northwestern Mutual the intensity seemed to be fully and firmly established, almost self-existent, and no longer dependent on any effort to support it.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Disciplined Energy</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is the difference between this youthful energy of a successful company still in its adolescence and the stable intensity of a mature institution? The best analogy we could think of is a comparison with a famous professional athlete like Jim Connors, Roger Staubach, or Mary Lou Retton at three different stages of their lives. First, imagine our future stars as children trying to learn how to hit a tennis ball, throw a football, or master the parallel bars. They are boundless and endless fonts of energy without measure or mission, running and jumping everywhere, restless, excited, exuberant. Their movements are clumsy, uncoordinated, and abrupt, because they are not yet masters of their own energies. The energy overflows in every direction but accomplishes very little, because the youngsters lack the skills necessary to control and direct it. This is the stage of many entrepreneurial companies still in their infancy. They subsist on excitement, enthusiasm, and the sheer thrill of the challenge. Now imagine our athletes in adolescence as stars on the high school team. They have gained a measure of control over their energies. Their movements are better coordinated. They have acquired many skills. Yet still, every action requires the utmost effort and concentration. They lack the confidence that comes with long experience. They are as yet nervous, jumpy, anxious, straining, and unsure of themselves. Like Apple they have won a lot of games and surpassed all their peers but have still to prove that they can survive in the big leagues. Finally, think of them as professional athletes at the peak of their careers. They have a calm bearing and steady poise. Every movement is well measured and precise without the slightest unnecessary expenditure of energy. They are in full control of their energies and have perfected their skills. They have a clear knowledge of and a confidence in their abilities. Those who meet them are awed by their very presence, as the computer industry is by IBM.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the child, energy is a raw force&mdash;uncontrolled, undirected, sporadic. It comes in sudden bursts of motion and ends in motionless exhaustion. In the professional, on the other hand, the energy is constant and stable, a solid state of radiant power. Between the uncontrolled raw energy of nature and the pure, power-packed intensity that is the summit of human achievement, there is a </span><span class="c2">vital difference</span><span class="c3">. We see this difference all around us. When energy is brought under control, focused in a particular direction, and harnessed for productive work, it generates intensity. The raw energy of Niagara Falls is converted into an intensity that can illuminate an entire city. The crushing force of millions of tons of water is captured and tamed by human invention and made productive. It is channeled through a carefully designed structure. Its kinetic energy is used to drive giant turbines, which convert it into electrical power. The electricity is directed through an extensive network of systems and delivered over long distances to the ultimate points of consumption, where it may be sharply focused as a tiny beam of electrons passing through the hair-thin filament of an incandescent bulb to illuminate a small room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A very similar process takes place within companies. All available energies must be harnessed by the organization, controlled by authority, and directed to work through systems and skills to achieve the desired goals. The greater the energies collected and harnessed, the more effectively they are controlled and directed, the more coordinated and integrated the systems through which they pass, and the more perfect the skills with which they are expressed, the greater is the productivity of the organization and the intensity it generates. As Feinberg put it: &quot;Great corporations focus disciplined energy. They channel their energies and avoid fragmentation, diffusion, and nonfocused activities, which are often characteristic of organizations that have lost their goals.&quot;</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Sources of &nbsp;Energy</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is not just energy that makes for corporate excellence. It is human energy converted into organizational intensity. An organization is a huge repository of latent and potential energies. Where do these energies come from? They come from people. Initially, it is the energy of the founder that gives life to an organization. The founder pours forth his or her energies onto the new creation much as a mother lavishes affection on her infant child. He or she devotes personal attention to every small detail of work, often doing the most mundane tasks himself or herself in the early years like Bill Marriott, Sr., who did the cooking himself in the first Hot Shoppe. The founder works endless hours giving form and substance to the company&mdash;hand-selecting employees, training them, designing systems and procedures, establishing priorities and goals, setting a personal example of the values he or she wants to instill in others.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By giving attention to the new recruits, teaching and training them, delegating authority, assigning responsibilities, and rewarding good performance, the founder builds up a core of employees who feel involved and dedicated to the company. They contribute not only their physical energies but their psychological energies as well. Their interest, excitement, enthusiasm, ambition, loyalty, and pride are channeled into the work. By attitude and example, the founder may also foster a spirit of cooperation and teamwork, as C. E. Woolman did at Delta during the early days when he had to pass the hat among employees to collect enough money to fuel the plane for the next flight. To the extent that people begin to feel part of a collective effort and a greater whole, they dedicate even more of their energies to the enterprise.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As the company grows, it requires a steady influx of new energy, talents, and capacities. Some of the early recruits lack the education, technical background, or managerial experience the work demands. A greater emphasis is placed on recruiting bright, educated talents with alert minds and new ideas. At a relatively early stage, the founders of Apple recognized the need for highly trained professionals to build up efficient production and marketing facilities that could effectively deliver their innovative products to large numbers of people at competitive prices. This influx of mental energies adds to the growing reservoir of corporate strength.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The young, developing company also forges relationships with the world around it. It wins some loyal customers who appreciate its products or services. It finds reliable suppliers that appreciate its regular business. It may attract investors willing to risk funds on the strength of the company&rsquo;s achievements and prospects. These people, too, contribute their energies to the growth of the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Though all growing enterprises draw energies from these various sources, companies do differ in the energies they possess. Much depends on the quality of the people they recruit&mdash;the importance the company places on selecting people with good health, enthusiasm for work, strong nerves, dynamism, expansiveness, education, and intelligence. But companies differ even more in the extent to which they are able to release, harness, and channel the various energy resources at their disposal into productive work. People are not a limited, finite resource like so many kilowatts of power or pounds of salt. People are a nearly limitless reservoir of physical, psychological, and mental energy and talent. The key is in knowing how to utilize peoples&rsquo; capacities to the full or, rather, how to motivate people to give themselves entirely to their work.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Shoe Power</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Tomas Bata was a man who possessed this key. He was the ninth generation in a family clan of shoemakers from the town of Ziln, in what was then Austria-Hungary, now Czechoslovakia. Tomas and his brother founded a shoemaking &quot;factory&quot; in their house at Ziln in 1894 with two sewing machines and some hand tools. Despite this rather modest beginning, Tomas&rsquo;s ambition was to transform shoemaking from a cottage handicraft into a modern industry run with shoe machinery. Inspired by the American system of mechanized production, which he studied during two visits to the United States, and by Henry Ford&rsquo;s idea of an inexpensive car for the masses, Bata dreamed of producing shoes in quantities large enough and at prices low enough to shod the feet of all humanity. By the end of World War I, he had built up a medium-sized shoe industry employing 2,000 workers and producing a half-million pairs of shoes annually, part of which was exported to other European countries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1922 Europe was in the midst of the first great postwar depression, which drastically cut Czechoslovakia&rsquo;s export trade, creating widespread unemployment throughout the country. The newly formed Czech government adopted a policy of tight monetary controls to fight inflation on the home front, resulting in a 75 percent devaluation in the currency in a single year. As a result of these factors, demand fell, purchasing power declined, and exports decreased to a fraction of their former level. Debtors, which included most businesses that had expanded on bank credit during the war, were suddenly faced with high levels of debt and falling incomes. Production declined. Layoffs multiplied. More than 400,000 Czechs were unemployed. Bata&rsquo;s business suffered badly. His exports dropped by 75 percent. Stocks were accumulating until his warehouses were full to overflowing. There was enormous pressure to cut production and lay off workers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In August of 1922 the national manufacturers&rsquo; association of Czechoslovakia called an urgent meeting of its members to discuss the government&rsquo;s policies and formulate recommendations to avert economic disaster. Those who attended felt they were helpless victims of external forces and government actions. They were nearly unanimous in condemning the government and demanding relief, but none could propose a viable solution to the problems facing the nation.</span></p><a id="id.i16r4bivupcx"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">On the second day of the conference. Tomas Bata rose to speak. Bata saw the futility of the government&rsquo;s policy and industry&rsquo;s response to it. He believed that some radically new strategy was needed to break the vicious cycle of economic decline. He was a man who firmly believed in seizing adversity by the horns and wrestling it into submission. He was also motivated by a deep sense of commitment to the thousands of people who depended on him for their livelihood and very survival. When Bata addressed the conference, he did not strike the familiar refrain demanding government action. Rather, he called on the business community to act courageously for its own preservation. He ended his speech with a dramatic announcement that startled the entire gathering. Bata refused to lay off a single worker. He chose instead to seize the initiative and act decisively. The first necessity was to stimulate market demand. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;we are going to cut the prices of our shoes in half and we are going to sell them for half the present price.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Bata&rsquo;s announcement brought a hushed silence, which was followed by squeals of derisive laughter. He was dismissed as a lunatic or a fool. How could a company cut its prices by 50 percent and survive? How could it ever repay its creditors by lowering prices?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bata returned to Ziln and explained his radical decision to his employees. It was the only possible solution to save the company and preserve their jobs. All costs had to be reduced to the absolute minimum. Waste of all description had to be completely eradicated. Efficiency and productivity had to be raised to much greater levels. He imposed across-the-board 40 percent wage cuts for all employees, despite the opposition of a powerful union, but he promised to supply all workers and their families with food, clothing, and other necessities at half the present price to ensure their maintenance. He divided his factory into profit centers and promised incentives for higher productivity. Having put his internal operations on a war footing, Bata launched a national poster advertising campaign depicting a huge fist crushing the Czech word </span><span class="c2">drahota</span><span class="c3">, which represented the high cost of living.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The public response was overwhelming. Shoe stores that had been languishing for months were suddenly invaded by mobs of people seeking an affordable pair of shoes. Police had to be called in to restore order and regulate traffic. Orders poured into the warehouses until they were almost empty of stock. The workshops were geared up to full production capacity. Within a week, the sense of uncertainty and despair was replaced by one of urgency, excitement, and purpose. In the coming months Bata not only maintained full employment but actually started to expand. He continuously introduced improved production techniques, administrative systems, and employee incentives to increase productivity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Over the next five years, employment in Bata&rsquo;s factories more than doubled, and production multiplied 15-fold. Between 1922 and 1932 the average retail price of Bata shoes fell by 82 percent, while wages in Bata factories rose by 200 percent. Like Henry Ford, Bata succeeded in producing so efficiently that a former luxury became accessible to the masses for the first time. By 1928 Bata operated the largest tanneries, shoe-making factories, and shoe machinery industry on earth. Czechoslovakia led the world in footwear exports, and the Czech people were the best shod in Europe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During this period Bata succeeded in releasing enormous energies latent within his small company and in tapping equally great energies from the world around him. He was a man who knew how to mobilize some of the infinite powers of an organization.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Levels of Energy Utilization</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If you look at various companies in any field, you can see how much they differ in their capacity to mobilize and harness the human resources at their disposal. Some waste a large portion of their energies by internal conflicts, pursuit of goals that turn out to be dead-end alleys, inefficient production techniques, and endless indecisiveness. Others conserve their energies through rigorous discipline and systematic controls, eliminating waste of all types, keeping costs down, staffs lean, and inventories low. Still others succeed in actively utilizing available energies in a constructive fashion for gradual but steady growth. Their employees perform well. They are open to suggestions and new ideas. They make every machine and system yield its maximum. Then there are those companies that expand at a very rapid pace by constantly releasing latent energies from within the organization and drawing fresh energies from outside. They enthuse their workers to make extraordinary efforts. They offer employees constant opportunities to acquire new skills and take on greater responsibility. They draw inspiration and ideas from their customers, attract the best talent in the field, and are sought after by investors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the pinnacle of corporate life are those companies that have discovered the secret of fashioning the human resources of which they are composed into an integrated and cohesive living organization. They have evolved to their present position through a long process of trial and error under the leadership of a few dynamic individuals who have imposed the imprint of their own dynamism and enthusiasm on the company. These companies utilize the energies at their disposal with consummate </span><span class="c2">skill</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and constantly seek to develop new skills so that latent talents can emerge. They channel these highly skilled energies through carefully designed </span><span class="c2">systems</span><span class="c3">. These systems are precisely co-ordinated with each other and perfectly integrated with the structure and functioning of the </span><span class="c2">organization</span><span class="c3">. The organization acts like an optical lens to focus all these energies for the fulfillment of the company&rsquo;s central </span><span class="c2">purpose</span><span class="c3">&mdash;its values, mission, and objectives.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Intense Crises and Opportunities</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every individual and every company have known periods when their energies reached peak levels of intensity. Such periods may come in response to a severe crisis, as the economic conditions in Czechoslovakia did for Tomas Bata and his company. During a crisis every drop of energy is mobilized to cope with the danger and ensure survival. When Chrysler Corporation found itself at the edge of the precipice in 1979, the threat of impending catastrophe released a great reservoir of pent-up energies from within the organization and brought forth unexpected reserves of support from suppliers, labor unions, bankers, and governments. Lee Iacocca was able to mobilize and utilize all these available energies for a dramatic revival of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Peak periods of intensity also occur in response to the opening up of new opportunities in the environment. In 1978 such an opportunity thrust itself on Merck, the most admired pharmaceuticals company in the United States, according to three successive </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;surveys.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The largest drug companies launch a major new product about once in two years and spend the remaining time promoting its use. But in 1978 Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, the United States prescription-drug manufacturing and marketing division of Merck &amp; Company, Inc., found that three major new products would be ready for introduction at virtually the same time. Rather than delay the introductions to provide more time for preparations, MSD decided to launch all three products within a period of 90 days, and it mobilized all its energies, talents, and resources for the effort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">No pharmaceuticals company had ever introduced three major products in three different therapeutic areas in such a short time. MSD&rsquo;s professional representatives set industry records in taking information on the new drugs to U.S. physicians. The company&rsquo;s representatives traveled more than 5 million miles in nine weeks. In the first week they called on 90 percent of all the opthalmologists in the United States&mdash;some 9,000 of them&mdash;to present the first of the three products, &quot;Timoptic.&quot; The operations department worked round the clock in 12-hour shifts, six days a week for almost three months to prepare 2.5 million special dispensers for that drug. In order to launch the second product, &quot;Clinoril,&quot; more than 110 million packaged tablets had to be prepared within a little over a month. Measured by the number of prescriptions filled in the first two months alone, it was the fastest-selling new prescription drug introduced in the United States in 20 years. During the third month, MSD representatives met over 50,000 physicians to discuss the new broad-spectrum antibiotic &quot;Mefoxin.&quot; In addition, 3.2 million pieces of promotional literature were printed and distributed for the three drugs in 61 days&mdash;a process that normally takes 90 days for a single new product.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What was the result of Merck&rsquo;s intensive effort? Six years later Timoptic is one of the world&rsquo;s leading medications for the treatment of glaucoma, Clinoril is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of arthritic conditions, and Mefoxin is the largest-selling antibiotic in the United States.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Intense Challenges</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Some companies do not wait for a crisis or an opportunity to generate maximum intensity. They consciously induce and maintain peak levels of intensity by setting goals or accepting challenges that can be achieved only by a constant, all-out effort. Milwaukee has never been regarded as a very exciting place to live. Nor is the life insurance industry thought of as a very exciting field. Nor would it appear that there could be anything very exciting about a life insurance company in Milwaukee that calls itself&quot; The Quiet Company.&quot; Yet appearances can be deceptive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is something exciting about life at 128-year-old North-western Mutual, the nation&rsquo;s tenth largest life insurance company, which ranks first in the industry by almost every performance criterion other than size. It is the most admired in its field according to </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s surveys of corporate reputations in 1983, 1984, and 1985. </span><span class="c2">Best&rsquo;s Review</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;rates it first among the 71 largest life insurance companies year after year on a variety of technical criteria. The largest business enterprise in Wisconsin, with $16 billion in assets, in 1984 Northwestern Mutual earned nearly $1.2 billion on its investments. Yet it remains restless and ambitious even at this ripe old age and is never quite satisfied with its achievements.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1984 Northwestern Mutual set a goal for itself that generated waves of excitement throughout the company and its 4,500-person agency field force and caused a few ripples in the rest of the industry as well. In January of that year, Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s president and CEO, Donald Schuenke, announced what he termed the &quot;$100 billion challenge.&quot; He called on the employees and agents to raise the value of the company&rsquo;s in-force insurance policies from $93 billion to $100 billion before the July annual meeting. To accomplish this goal, the firm would have to accelerate new-policy issues by roughly 30 percent during this period, which would require a dramatic increase in sales as well as in all the administrative paperwork involved in evaluating and issuing policies. For a company that was already the most productive among industry leaders in terms of amount of insurance written per employee and per dollar of operating costs, an additional 30 percent increase would be no mean achievement.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The $100 billion challenge demanded not only a tremendous effort and dedication but also extremely high levels of coordination between the field and office staff. &quot;Quiet days&quot; were instituted, during which the new-business department did not answer any telephone calls. Productivity on these days rose from the normal average of processing $78 million of business a day to $105 million. At the July 23 agents&rsquo; annual meeting, Schuenke announced that the company not only had reached the target but had done so two weeks early, making North-western Mutual only the fourth company in the industry to cross the mark of $100 billion of individual life insurance coverage.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Celebrated Challenge</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A far cry from quiet Milwaukee, with its Germanic work ethic and traditional conservatism&mdash;until a few years ago, drinking coffee (except at lunch) was forbidden at Northwestern Mutual&mdash;there is another company where creating challenges to generate intensity has become a way of life. On April 24, 1984, San Francisco&rsquo;s Moscone Center became the focal point for a $2 million dealer extravaganza. Some 3,500 people, including 2,000 North American dealers and 1,500 sales reps and software and peripheral-product developers plus members of the press, gathered for the launching of Apple&rsquo;s new IIc computer, amid flashing lights, stereo music, stirring speeches, and hoopla. And as if all that were not intense enough, the celebration was perfectly timed to coincide with an earthquake that registered 6.2 on the Richter scale.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The IIc introduction formed part of a carefully conceived and well-executed strategy, which Apple calls &quot;event marketing&quot; and which involves such functions as sales support, public relations, software development, and so on. Besides the excitement, the Moscone event also generated 50,000 orders for the Apple IIc, making it one of the most successful single product introductions in the history of the computer industry. Like the &quot;$100 billion challenge,&quot; &quot;Apple II Forever&quot; was an attempt to release energy and channel it into productive work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apple has accomplished its meteoric rise by capturing the imagination of the American people with a unique combination of sophisticated technology and an almost playful people-orientation, which the company&rsquo;s logo&mdash;a rainbow-colored apple with a bite taken out&mdash;calls to mind. Apple&rsquo;s real strength is its appeal to a vision of the future in which people and machines can live harmoniously and happily together. The Moscone event was designed to release the enthusiastic energies of Apple&rsquo;s staff, sales channels, and third-party developers of software and peripherals.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Event marketing at Apple is far more than a mere publicity stunt. It is clearly attuned to the realities of a highly competitive, rapidly changing market where limited retail shelf space has forced a narrowing of the field to a few major brands and failure to become a total success may be tantamount to total failure. A highly motivated and directed workforce and an enthusiastic customer base are critical not only to growth but even to survival in this industry. Event marketing is &quot;a way that we can all focus on what we have to accomplish internally within Apple to make it happen.&quot; says Del Yocam, executive vice-president of the Apple II Division; &quot;and it&rsquo;s also a way that we can bring all of the external forces together&mdash;our dealer base and rep firms, vendors, press, and analysts.&quot; Apple is consciously releasing and focusing energies, internally and externally, for its growth.</span></p><p class="c4 c30"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Intensity Versus Excitement</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">While acknowledging the success of Apple&rsquo;s strategy, we must be careful not to confuse focused intensity with agitated excitement. Corporate intensity is a rich, highly productive atmosphere based on alert, brisk, harmonious physical functioning, supported by dynamism, enthusiasm, cooperation, and expansiveness, in pursuit of clear values and objectives, whereas an effervescent excitement is a high-pitched, short-lived burst of undirected energy, basically unstable and unproductive, a form of feverish movement that shoots up rapidly and later crashes down. It is the intensity of destruction. For lasting achievement, excitement must be transformed into productive energy and institutionalized as corporate intensity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Effervescent energy and agitated excitement are a common response to the sudden expansion of new markets, such as the explosive growth in demand for video games between 1979 and 1982, when profits grew by 600 percent, or the nearly tenfold growth in the personal computer market from 1980 to 1983. When the market suddenly opens up like this, hundreds of companies rush forward to share in the wind-fall. The number of American personal computer makers doubled to over 200 between 1981 and 1983.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During the initial period of expansion, demand far exceeds supply, customers clamor for the product, sales boom, and profits soar for every company that happens to be in the field. Activision, Inc. began manufacturing video game cartridges in 1979 with $700,000 in capital and by 1982 had sales of over $60 million. Apple, which had assets of $5,309 at the beginning of 1977, had a stock market value of $1.79 billion by the end of 1980. Intoxicated by fantastic predictions of exponential growth of demand, exhilarated by the rapidity of their rise, companies hurry to grab a larger share of the profits and work with desperate speed to produce and sell more than the competition, without thought for the morrow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During this phase the customer will buy anything he or she can lay hands on, regardless of quality. Companies prosper even if their product is poor, price high, service indifferent, and attitude rude or arrogant. In the scramble for rapid expansion, most companies ignore the basics of sound management. Systems are absent or only partly functional. The hierarchy of authority is ill-defined or frequently by-passed. There is no insistence on perfect quality, since the market will take anything the firms produce. There is no need to try to please the customer, since the customer is happy just to get the product. Standards for recruitment fall, because there is a shortage of quality personnel in the marketplace. Training of workers is abridged by the urgent demand for greater production. Normal levels of cleanliness and orderliness in office and factory give way to dirt, disorder, and sloppiness generated by the rush to meet deadlines. In such an expansive and buoyant climate, even minimum levels of efficiency are enough to earn high profits. Standards are low, lapses are tolerated, and sales gimmicks work wonders.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When everyone is reaching for the moon, there are a few companies that keep their feet on the ground, their nerves steady, and their eyes leveled on the horizon. When everyone else is excited and jubilant, they remain calm and keep their heads. At a time when even the minimum is enough, they insist on giving their maximum. These few exceptional companies understand that those who take temporary advantage of temporary movements will be temporary companies. They go out of their way to please the customer, even when it is not required to make the sale. They strive to develop the best technology, and they insist on quality, even when the market neither demands it nor rewards it by a higher price. They continue to display courteous behavior during the pressure of heavy work. They try to maintain prompt payment schedules, even when suppliers are fighting with each other to sell them goods on any terms. They take pains to carefully build up their organization, even though it distracts them from production to meet waiting demand. They insist on systematic functioning through appropriate channels, despite the temptation for urgent on-the-spot personal management by the CEO. They maintain high standards of cleanliness and orderliness, as if they were in no big hurry. They recruit their staff with great care, even if it means taking on fewer new hands. They refuse to abridge the training process to catch a few extra worker-days for production. These companies make an enormous psychological effort to adhere to the basics when others are rushing after gold. They work extremely hard and methodically, expending more energy than the situation demands, and this effort creates the foundation for corporate intensity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the period of mushrooming growth is over, when sales peak and begin to decline and prices start to drop, when the giant corporations in the field move in to take over from the hundreds of small fries, companies begin to fall as rapidly as they rose. The effervescent ones disappear. The excited ones totter. Those that ignored quality find no market. Those that ignored the customer find they have none. Those with low efficiency cannot compete at a lower price. When, like the South Sea bubble, the boom starts to collapse, companies scramble for survival. They cut production, reduce prices, discharge staff, close facilities, introduce countless gimmicks and giveaways to get rid of swelling inventories. This is 1983 for the video game industry, when Atari, Inc. lost half a billion dollars and cut its payroll by 30 percent, when Mattel Inc.&rsquo;s electronics division lost around $400 million and pushed the entire company close to bankruptcy before Mattel sold it off, when the Timex Group Ltd. slashed prices on its personal computer by 50 percent and still saw its sales cut in half within two months before it finally bailed out of the market altogether.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Now the honeymoon is over, and only the very best can survive. Unless you please the customers, they will not buy. Unless your quality is high, the product does not sell. Unless operating costs are low, every sale generates a loss. As companies fold, the competition thins out. Those that stuck to the basics during the boom find that their customers remain loyal, their markets remain healthy. They still earn profits despite falling prices because their efficiency is high and systems are fully operative. Apple survives and continues to surprise the experts, while countless others fade from memory. This is the phase when giant companies dominate the field. Growth is slow. It requires a hundred times greater energy to survive than it did during the initial period of expansion. Those companies that have been faithful to the seminal values that nourish an organization are able to survive and grow. They pass the test in a million details of everyday functioning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During the ascending spiral of the market, when it is commercially unnecessary and psychologically difficult to stick to the basics, these companies maintain them as a religious ritual. During the downward spiral, when it is a physical necessity to do even ordinary things perfectly, these companies are able to, because the habit of perfection is already deeply ingrained. The effort these companies have made to stick to essential corporate values through all the vicissitudes of the market cycle has generated an intensity that saturates the organization and overflows on all sides. This intensity is a vast reservoir of productive power that could eventually carry the company to the top of its field.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">One That Made It</span></p><a id="id.cm7v3bv9ekdt"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apple began in the mid-1970s, like hundreds of other garage operations, with few expectations, no resources, and no clear direction, knowledge, or experience to guide it. Yet early in Apple&rsquo;s career, it began to differentiate itself from the pack. In the first year it was probably held together more by &quot;a relentless pressure&quot; than by anything else.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><a id="id.m8tgreuqibhp"></a><span class="c3">There were plenty of the errors that youthful exuberance is prone to, but &quot;the early gaffes were concealed by the forgiving nature of an expanding market.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At a very early stage, Apple began to reach out for the knowledge and expertise its founders lacked. Much of its success must be attributed to its ability to recruit highly qualified professionals with greater talents than the immediate situation necessitated or warranted. The influx of experienced executives helped instill a sense of discipline, while the informal, unconventional atmosphere fostered innovation and expansiveness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The dramatic response of the market to the Apple II reinforced the vision of the founders that the personal computer was revolutionizing society&mdash;and gave the company an inspiring mission around which to rally all its energies. The structure, systems, and skills brought in from outside provided a means to channel these youthful energies into productive work. A succession of talented, hard-nosed presidents managed to instill a nontraditional type of order and discipline without killing the company&rsquo;s idealism and enthusiasm. Within eight years a garage operation had been transformed into a publicly held, divisionalized, multinational corporation holding revenues of $1.5 billion in 1984.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Attention to the Smallest Customer</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy is the starting point; intensity is the result. But how does that intensity express itself? It is expressed in every action a company initiates, in the smallest and least significant as much as in the largest and most important. In fact, the greater the intensity, the smaller the act in which it is manifested. It is not the grand, dramatic events&mdash;the crises and the challenges&mdash;that are the truest measure of corporate intensity. It is in the way a company attends to its ordinary customers, the way it relates to its lowest-level employees, the way it performs its most ordinary routine daily acts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most companies dote on their biggest customers and smother them with VIP service. Every letter receives a prompt, courteous, and proper reply. Every complaint is listened to with due sympathy for the customer&rsquo;s viewpoint. Every error is generously compensated. Every appointment and time schedule is adhered to with perfect punctuality. The company displays great thoughtfulness in anticipating its most important customer&rsquo;s needs and preferences as well as a strong desire to please in every way possible. All this requires a very great effort by the entire company, from the CEO at the top, who may have to personally call on the customer to take an order or handle a problem, all the way down to the shipping department, which must follow the customer&rsquo;s special packing instructions without error and deliver merchandise at short notice on a high-priority basis, bypassing other customer orders to do so. In dealing with the VIP, everyone&rsquo;s energy and enthusiasm are at a high pitch, cooperation between people and departments is at a maximum, the organization puts on its best performance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But when it comes to the small customer, how many companies extend the same consideration and treat them with the same sense of importance? The common experience of small customers is that their orders are the last to be filled, their letters often &quot;misplaced&quot; and never answered, and their complaints most frequently ignored. The effort required to extend VIP service to the smallest customer is truly enormous. Every staff member must be continuously full of enthusiasm and on his or her best behavior. Every system must work smoothly and flawlessly. Punctuality must be maintained as an established routine, no longer a special effort. All this requires a tremendous expenditure of energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For C. E. Woolman, the founding patriarch of Delta, every single customer was precious. &quot;Get me one more passenger,&quot; he was always saying. Add one more passenger to every Delta flight and you are adding $50 million in revenues a year. Jim Ewing, Delta&rsquo;s director of national media and internal publications, recalls that one time when he boarded a flight with Woolman, a flight attendant informed them that the plane was overbooked. Woolman turned to Ewing and said, &quot;Jim, it looks like you and I are going to have time for a cup of coffee back in the terminal.&quot; When a newly employed executive called up Delta&rsquo;s station manager in New York ordering him to hold the next flight for ten minutes till he could reach the airport, the station manager contacted a flight controller who called Woolman for clearance. Woolman replied, &quot;Have I ever asked you to hold a flight for me? Send her off on time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Woolman&rsquo;s attitude toward the customer pervades the Delta organization from top to bottom. Flight attendants Chris Hendrix and Lynn Gauwitz could both recall occasions when they gave their own food to hungry passengers on flights without meal service. When an elderly disabled woman showed up unescorted for a Delta flight, another Delta flight attendant, who was just leaving duty for a few days off, volunteered to fly for another eight hours as a passenger in order to escort the woman safely home.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Keeping to the flight schedule is a commandment at Delta. Delta mechanics often assist in loading baggage to ensure that flights take off on time. If a Delta flight is behind schedule for whatever reason, any available employee, including executives, may pitch in to clean the cabin so the plane can leave sooner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Delta&rsquo;s marketing division is constantly striving to improve the speed and courtesy of its phone reservation agents. Recently Delta has brought down the average time for answering phone reservation calls to the very low level of 20 seconds, even during peak hours.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a result of such a persistent and dedicated effort to serve the customer best, the entire organization rises to a peak level of performance and maintains itself there. The enormous energy expended&mdash;or rather, invested&mdash;is converted into a constant state of organizational intensity.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Attention to the Lowest-Level Employee</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the higher levels of management, most firms maintain respectful and cordial relationships among colleagues, with people adjusting for each other&rsquo;s convenience, tolerating mistakes, and refraining from open confrontations. How much greater effort is required to display the same patience, courtesy, understanding, and tolerance when dealing with subordinates as we express in dealing with colleagues and superiors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bill Marriott, Jr., president and CEO of Marriott, says that one of the real keys to his father&rsquo;s success in building up what eventually became a major multibillion-dollar corporation from a single root beer stand was the way Bill, Sr., related to his hourly employees. &quot;In establishing the culture of the company, there was a lot of attention and tender loving care paid to the hourly workers. When they were sick, he went to see them. When they were in trouble, he got them out of trouble. He created a family loyalty.&quot;</span></p><a id="id.qa2drl2aqb06"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During the early 1930s, when Bill Marriott, Sr., was operating six Hot Shoppes in the Washington, D.C., area, he and his wife would frequently drop into the restaurants at off-hours to chat with the manager, cooks, and waitresses. He firmly believed that if you want to please the customer in a service business, &quot;you&rsquo;ve got to make your employees happy. If the employees are happy, they are going to make the customers happy.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">C. E. Woolman recognized from the outset that Delta was in the people business, dedicated to serving people, and to carry out that mission, the key ingredient was people. Delta&rsquo;s president, Ron Allen, says of Woolman: &quot;He showed so much interest in the individual. For example, it was not unusual to find him in the hangar talking to the mechanics, just seeing how the day was going.&quot; Woolman took great pleasure in bringing his homegrown orchids to the office for the ladies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Woolman&rsquo;s attention to employees has become institutionalized at Delta. Every year teams of top executives go around to meet with every group of employees in the country to discuss the company&rsquo;s current objectives and hear whatever employees have to say. We pressed Hollis Harris, senior vice-president for passenger service, to tell us what it is he tries to communicate during these meetings. &quot;The main thing we are trying to communicate to our people is that we are interested in their problems and their suggestions. We are concerned with them personally. We believe that if we do communicate that, they will communicate the same attitude to our customers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Delta considers each and every employee so important that even before hiring an agent in Seattle, the company will fly the final candidate all the way to Atlanta for a final round of interviews. Delta&rsquo;s open-door policy enables virtually any worker in the company to meet the chairman or president with a suggestion or a complaint. To listen carefully and consider every idea that comes from anywhere within the organization requires genuine openness, considerable psychological effort, and enormous patience. How much easier it is to just keep the door closed!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When each employee in an organization is treated and treats others with respect and importance usually accorded only to top management, the very best attitude and behavior are brought out. Cooperation, coordination, and harmony grow to a far higher level. Every employee exhibits a far greater sense of commitment and responsibility. The employees&rsquo; full energies and enthusiasm are released and get magnified by reverberation. A positive milieu is built up within the organization that becomes a permanent culture of the company and a rich, supportive atmosphere of intensity.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Success in Small Matters</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The intensity generated by serving the smallest customer and relating to the lowest-level employee also results from giving full attention to every routine detail of work.</span></p><a id="id.63y7y3781hfh"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Roberto Goizueta, chairman and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola, really believes that &quot;God is in the details.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><a id="id.krlkghevdtjj"></a><span class="c3">Francis Rodgers, a recently retired vice-president of IBM, says, &quot;above all we want a reputation for doing the little things well.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Julius Gwin, comptroller at Delta Air Lines, told us: &quot;One of the reasons the company is so successful is that people pay attention to small details.&quot; C. E. Woolman set the tone by his own words and actions. Elimination of waste was one area where Woolman was really a fanatic for detail, and everyone knew it. When a relay tower was being dismantled, the supervisor was concerned about how to dispose of 70 feet of rusty wire that had been used as a support. He knew Woolman would not approve of discarding it. While the supervisor was contemplating what action to take, Woolman arrived on the scene and inquired how the wire was going to be used. The supervisor replied, to Woolman&rsquo;s approval, that he planned to sand it down and reuse it. A week later Woolman visited the workshop to ask the supervisor about the wire. The supervisor assured him that it was being sanded. The next morning Woolman returned with the secretary-general of the United Nations, whom he was showing around the premises. Woolman was pleased to find the supervisor sanding the wire himself. &quot;It&rsquo;s good,&quot; he remarked, &quot;to see people who attend to details.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Expenditure is another area where Delta is obsessed with small details. That is part of the reason why Delta has earned the title of &quot;the world&rsquo;s most profitable airline.&quot; Cost control at Delta is both comprehensive and minutely detailed. All items of expenditure above $1,000 in this $4 billion company must be approved by an executive committee headed by the president, which meets every Monday. Lesser amounts can be sanctioned by a senior vice-president but are still reported to the committee on a list the following week.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Item:Typewriter rental, $95</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Item:Snacks for employee meeting, $90</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Item:Dishwasher repair, $309</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Just how small an expenditure is of concern to Delta? Gwin says that he and Frank Chew, the treasurer, &quot;can spend up to $25 with impunity!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is in the small, routine items of work that the most successful companies surpass the rest. It is not very difficult for staff members to be punctual for a conference addressed by the chairperson of the board or a sales meeting with a $10 million customer. But to maintain punctuality for routine daily meetings with subordinates is very rare in most companies. It is easy to clean factory floors and polish machinery in anticipation of a scheduled visit by the CEO, but to constantly maintain high levels of cleanliness requires a tenfold effort. Many companies reply to important phone calls and letters on a high-priority basis, but to respond to every call and letter the same day requires a highly disciplined, well-organized, and dedicated staff. Important correspondence and documents are usually kept safe and are &quot;only occasionally&quot; misplaced in most organizations. But how many companies maintain faultless systems for filing the least important piece of paper?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Even after Marriott Corporation had grown to include hundreds of facilities around the country, Bill, Sr., vowed he would personally inspect every restaurant and hotel at least four times a year. Don Mitchell, vice-chairman of Marriott and former president of Sylvania, called Bill, Sr., &quot;a perfectionist of the most avid type.&quot; If during a tour he saw a few cigarette butts on the floor, he would pick them up and say, &quot;The restaurants are filthy.&quot; Today the company is far too big for any single individual to visit all its facilities even once a year. But Bill, Jr., and other senior executives try to visit as many as possible and to continue the tradition. What is the smallest thing they look for when they visit a Marriott hotel? Fingerprints on the brass door rails, dirt in the light fixtures.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everyone makes an exceptional effort to perform well under exceptional circumstances, but the truest test of efficiency is how an organization carries out small, recurring routine tasks. Even in very successful companies, 25 percent of routine work may not be done properly on a regular basis. If the </span><span class="c2">smallest</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;work at the lowest level is always to be done well, it is not enough that employees are motivated, or that supervisors are attentive, or even that middle-level managers take interest in it. It is only when top management is fully committed to perfection at the lowest level that it can be achieved and maintained. Proper performance of routine work in each department depends on proper execution of routine work in other departments to which it is related. Consistency between departments depends on the establishment of uniform standards at a higher level that are passed down, monitored, and enforced. That is why the drive for perfection must pervade the entire organization from top to bottom in order to be successful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Companies like Delta and Marriott that make an extraordinary effort to do ordinary things promptly and perfectly raise their normal level of performance to a high pitch of intensity and release a hundredfold greater energy for growth.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Effort Releases Energy</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Where does all this energy come from for investing in excellent performance and building up organizational intensity? The more energy an individual or organization expends on constructive work, the greater the energy at its disposal and the greater its strength. How does a bodybuilder build up his or her body? By constantly expending more and more muscular energy in constructive physical exercises. How does a runner build up endurance for longer races? By constantly running farther and harder each day. Every runner and every successful executive knows the phenomenon of &quot;second wind.&quot; You run and run, work and work, until you have exhausted your last breath, and suddenly a miracle happens. A full breath of fresh air fills the empty lungs, a burst of fresh energy fills the tired limbs or dull mind. The gold-medal runner is one who is constantly exhausting every ounce of energy and constantly getting &quot;second winds,&quot; and companies that generate high intensity are much the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The founders of successful companies are only rarely people of exceptional talent. But they are almost universally people who work very hard and are able to inspire others to work hard, too. They are sharply focused and highly disciplined and direct all their energies to give life to something greater than themselves.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Creativity, achievement, and enduring success are associated with high levels of energy. Successful individuals and companies somehow are able to release, mobilize, harness, and control these energies through an effort of will and self-discipline and channel them into productive and carefully executed work. In the process, these unstable raw energies are converted into a steady state of radiating intensity that saturates the organization. This process involves not only the physical energies that move our bodies but also the psychological energies that excite, motivate, and enthuse us and the mental energies that inform and inspire our thoughts. The intensity that results may be expressed as a dynamic power for focused action, as at Merck; a calm, steady, unagitated drive to excel, as at Northwestern Mutual; a rich, cheerful, overflowing enthusiasm, as at Delta; or a clear perception and firm commitment to the realization of a high and distant goal, as at Apple.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Perhaps the ultimate example of this state in the individual is the self-mastery, perfect harmony, and grace of ballet dancers. Compared to the energetic, clumsy, and uncontrolled gestures of children, the movements of mature dancers are poetry in motion. Every muscle of their body is under perfect self-control. The nerves are absolutely calm. There is no trace of excitement or agitation in the expression on their face or in the rhythm of their dance. Their mind is alert, concentrated, still. They are able to move from a state of tranquil repose to dynamic action in a flash, to suddenly freeze animated in midair and again resume their dance with perfect form and graceful ease. Calm, power, harmony, and perfection are the attributes of excellence in dancers and in companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The highest art of dancers is expressed in the gestures that accompany their movements&mdash;a slight turn of the hand, the blinking of their eyes, the faint glimmer of a smile on their lips. The highest art of corporate excellence is expressed in the smooth, graceful execution of the least significant routine acts&mdash;a warm, cheerful tone in the service agent&rsquo;s voice, a letter promptly and properly answered, a file in its correct place, a storeroom or light fixture immaculately clean, a genuine concern for the lowest-ranking person in the organization.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.ps3kajh1sjid"><span class="c3">The conversion of energy into intensity and the expression of that intensity in the perfect execution of work are the keys to the achievement of enduring success. But who is to generate this intensity, and how is it to be done? To answer these questions we must first introduce ourselves to the most important person in the life of any organization&mdash;which some may be surprised to learn is not the founder or even the CEO.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37 c74">Chapter 2 - Psychoanalyzing the Corporation</span></h1><p class="c39"><span class="c3">Who is it that can tell me who I am?</span></p><p class="c39 c46"><span class="c3">&mdash;Shakespeare</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&quot;One mark of a great man is the power of making lasting impressions upon people he meets,&quot; wrote Churchill.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was one of the greatest literary figures the world has ever known. A poet, playwright, scientist, statesman, philosopher, novelist, journalist, educationist, critic, painter, and theater manager&mdash;he was one of the last outstanding Renaissance personalities. Goethe and Napoleon were contemporaries, two giant figures of their age, both intellectual geniuses. Goethe followed Napoleon&rsquo;s career and admired him as the greatest mind that ever lived. But Napoleon knew very little of Goethe and had no inkling of his greatness until they met for the first time at a peace conference in 1808. Napoleon was seated at a breakfast table surrounded by guests when Goethe appeared in silhouette before the open door and was invited to enter by the emperor. When Goethe stepped in, Napoleon fell silent, full of amazement at the sight of the man before him, too full of admiration to speak. Only three words escaped his lips: &quot;Voil&agrave; un homme!&quot; (&quot;Here is a man!&quot;)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have already seen in Chapter 1 that great individuals possess great intensity. But it was not Goethe&rsquo;s energy alone that so impressed Napoleon. It was the beauty, harmony, and graceful majesty of Goethe&rsquo;s personality reflected in the radiant expression on his face. Energy is only a force&mdash;which can be used for creation or destruction, depending on how it is directed. Personality determines the direction in which the energy flows and the manner in which it is expressed. It is personality, not just energy, that distinguishes the great builders from the great destroyers, Augustus Caesar from Attila the Hun; the great emancipators from the great tyrants, Abraham Lincoln from Adolf Hitler; the great benefactors of humanity from the great enemies, Albert Schweitzer from Al Capone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Human personality is an enigma that is more easily experienced than explained. There is something about it that eludes definition. It is that in a person which makes a unique individual. Yet although it defies description, the experience of it can be quite overwhelming. A friend of Goethe&rsquo;s once wrote to him of her first meeting with Beethoven. &quot;When I saw him of whom I shall now speak to you, I forgot the whole world.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span class="c3">After meeting Teddy Roosevelt, a visitor remarked: &quot;You go to the White House, you shake hands with Roosevelt and hear him talk&mdash;and then you go home to wring the personality out of your clothes.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Corporate &quot;I&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Individuals have personalities; corporations do, too. &quot;I think almost every enterprise&mdash;even the smallest ones&mdash;have personalities,&quot; says Thomas J. Bata, chairman of the world&rsquo;s largest shoe company. &quot;I don&rsquo;t believe, even if you take two service stations, that they are entirely the same.&quot; Jim Weaver, vice-president and treasurer of General Mills, agrees, &quot;Every company has a personality.&quot; In company after company that we visited, we talked with dozens of people, and always the answer was the same as that of Brooke Tunstall, corporate vice-president of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company: &quot;Absolutely, there is a corporate personality.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Intel the company is conscious of a corporate personality and teaches new employees about it. &quot;Every organization has &hellip; a personality that develops and evolves over time.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Larry Hootnick, senior vice-president at Intel, described the company as &quot;tough, demanding, honest, result-oriented, self-critical, a little paranoid&mdash;I think you have to be paranoid to succeed in a field like this&mdash;insecure, bright, aggressive people, very fast moving.&quot; Jim Jarrett added, &quot;spartan, non-paternalistic, straight-ahead focus, goal-oriented.&quot; Dick Sermone, personnel manager, used three terms to describe Intel&rsquo;s personality: &quot;Energy, discipline, high intelligence.&quot; What about family feeling, of which we hear so much nowadays? &quot;I don&rsquo;t know if I like the word </span><span class="c2">family</span><span class="c3">,&quot; he replied. &quot;I think it&rsquo;s a very business-oriented environment here, very open.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We were struck by the similarities and differences between the personality of Intel and that of its younger crosstown cousin, Apple. Jay Elliot, Apple&rsquo;s vice-president for human resources, depicted Apple as &quot;very bright&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost like an adolescent&mdash;free spirited, having great ideas, fighting this Goliath in the marketplace. It doesn&rsquo;t think it can&rsquo;t win, which is sort of incredible when you think of 5,000 people versus 400,000. It sort of has this brash attitude that it can do anything it wants. The people here love it. We&rsquo;re headed by Steve Jobs, who is almost like a messiah to us, a very bright young person having the vision of where we&rsquo;re going. It&rsquo;s a place where you can be free, you can express yourself and do things you&rsquo;ve never been able to do before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Del Yocam, executive vice-president of the Apple II Division, commented: &quot;The personality shows itself as being young, aggressive, risk-taking, bright, intelligent. You know we are going to give it our all. If we fail, we&rsquo;ll fail together. But we are going to succeed, and we&rsquo;re all going to share in that success. We think we allude to the American dream. We think we can do it, and we all believe that. I&rsquo;ve read in the paper that it&rsquo;s a cocky or ego-oriented situation, but it&rsquo;s not really that way from within. We really believe in what we&rsquo;re doing, so I think you get that kind of feeling and personality about the company.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sue Espinosa described her first impression on joining Apple in 1980: &quot;I didn&rsquo;t have to wear a business suit or anything special to establish a credibility there. Apple cared more about what you could do than what you looked like. Getting the job done, and doing it really well, and really creatively, was what Apple was all about.&quot; How does Sue describe Apple&rsquo;s personality? &quot;We dare to do things that we should never have dared to do. There has never been an attitude at Apple that we&rsquo;re not big enough to do this, or we&rsquo;re not important enough to do this, or not well enough known. Somehow in 1978, &rsquo;79, and &rsquo;80, we were able to create a </span><span class="c2">cult</span><span class="c3">. Apple is a cult now. There is something beyond the machine, which is </span><span class="c2">magic</span><span class="c3">. I don&rsquo;t know how we did it, but there is something. It happened.&quot; Sue frequently repeated a word used by every person we talked to at Apple&mdash;</span><span class="c2">fun</span><span class="c3">. &quot;It&rsquo;s just fun to be here. We&rsquo;re encouraged to have fun. Work hard, play hard. We are a force!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The contrast between Intel and Apple is strongly influenced by the differences in the personalities of their founders and their products. Intel was founded by scientists Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. The products it makes, silicon chips, are mass-produced and sold in a highly competitive market where even a few cents in production cost can mean the difference between big profits and heavy losses. The company operates with clockwork precision and discipline, necessitated by the technical complexity of the production process and by competitive pressures, principally from the Japanese. It is informal and free from external status symbols. Hootnick&rsquo;s office is an immaculate cubicle. Not even the chairman has a reserved parking space. Everything is measured to the nth degree&mdash;even the number of square feet that a janitor can clean&mdash;to keep costs at the absolute minimum.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apple, on the other hand, was started by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the latter having recently returned from wandering around India in search of spiritual enlightenment. It entered a market where the customer is an individual consumer, not another manufacturer. Competition was very intense here, too, but the primary factor was not cost&mdash;Jobs and Apple President John Sculley debated back and forth on whether to price the Macintosh personal computer at $1,995 or $2,495.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The primary factor is customer appeal. Being able to attract the buyer through marketing was the key. Apple set out to capture the imagination of the consumer with its vision of the future. To do so it had first to capture the imagination of its own employees through a combination of inspiring ideas, exciting challenges, enormous freedom for individual initiative, lucrative compensation, and fun. At Apple &quot;many employees see their work as an evangelical calling to bring computers to the masses,&quot; reports </span><span class="c2">Business Week</span><span class="c3">. In the words of John Sculley: &quot;At Apple we have a chance to change society.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Personality and Culture</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What people described to us at Intel and Apple was a varied assortment of beliefs, values, attitudes, customs, and behaviors that are frequently referred to these days as the main constituent elements of corporate culture. But there is something more than just culture here. The word </span><span class="c2">culture</span><span class="c3">, as it is generally applied to a company, refers to &quot;the amalgam of shared values, behavior patterns, mores, symbols, attitudes and normative ways of conducting business that, more than its products and services, differentiates it from all other companies.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What we found was something much deeper than beliefs and behavior, though encompassing them both. Beliefs and behavior are characteristics of a living being, but who is that person who so believes and so acts? We come face to face with what Don Schuenke, president and CEO of Northwestern Mutual, described as &quot;something living here, a personality.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every human being has a rich assortment of ideas, values, attitudes, and various recognizable ways of conducting himself or herself. The person&rsquo;s beliefs and opinions are influenced by education and life experience, by people met, books read, movies watched. His or her patterns of behavior also change according to the time and place, the people he or she is with, the social and work environment. But through all these changes of thought and action, the basic personality&mdash;the individual&rsquo;s motives, character, temperament, habits&mdash;remains the same.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Personality: Energy and Direction</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Beliefs and values strongly influence the formation of personality, individual or corporate, but they are not the personality itself, only attributes of it. In </span><span class="c2">Personality and Organization</span><span class="c3">, Chris Argyris writes: &quot;Personality is something different from the sum of the parts; it is an organization of those parts.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c3">Personality tells us who a person is, not just what the person thinks or how he or she acts. Personality is the source of the energy that drives the individual. As Argyris put it, &quot;Personality manifests energy.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;It is also the character or will that channels the energy into action. It includes the traits and skills through which the energy is expressed in behavior and that give a distinct personal color to each gesture and action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">To the extent that the personality is developed and integrated around some central core of values and goals, it controls and directs all the available energies, channels them through its traits of character, expresses them through its habits and skills in actions aimed at the fulfillment of its life purpose. In the process, raw energy is converted into intensity. The more powerful and well integrated the personality, the higher its aims, the stronger its organizing will, and the more varied and developed its skills, the greater is the energy it can harness and the intensity it can generate, and the greater the results it can achieve in life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Napoleon was one of the most powerful and well-integrated personalities of all time. Will and Ariel Durant describe him as &quot;an exhausting force, a phenomenon of energy contained and explosive.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><a id="id.rpkcv6gemq0g"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;But energy in him ceased to be a raw, unbridled force of nature. It was tamed and trained, restrained and disciplined, made orderly and obedient by an indomitable will and a strong, unified character. He was gifted with many skills and capacities. All his energy, will, and talent were directed toward the fulfillment of one lifetime goal&mdash;the quest for power. His ambitious character developed, mobilized, coordinated, harmonized, and integrated all of his manifold skills, talents, capacities, and traits to achieve this single aim. Napoleon, as Will and Ariel Durant put it, &quot;was the finest master of controlled complexity and coordinated energy in history.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup></p><a id="id.wt16f4nlq7si"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In physics the resultant effect of a physical force is determined by its energy and its direction. The force of a personality in life is also determined by its energy and direction. Napoleon had one direction, Mahatma Gandhi another. Gandhi was also a powerful and integrated personality, a man of incredible energy and endurance, but his motives and goal were quite different. He directed all his energies toward the liberation of India from British rule. Like Napoleon, Gandhi was absolutely fearless. During battles Napoleon often rode along the front lines of his army and exposed himself to enemy fire without any apparent concern. In Wellington&rsquo;s judgment, &quot;his presence on the battlefield was worth forty thousand men.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Gandhi walked unarmed into Indian villages where raging communal warfare between Hindus and Muslims had taken thousands of lives and quelled violence by his very presence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Napoleon tried to create a new empire by force of arms, and in the end he failed. Gandhi tried to destroy an old empire by force of words and ultimately succeeded. Napoleon, unsatisfied with being ruler of France alone, craved dominion over all of Europe. Gandhi&rsquo;s sole ambition was to see his country free; when absolute power was offered to him at the time of Indian independence, he turned away from politics. Both men possessed energy, willpower, and total dedication to the mission of their lives&mdash;one to serve humanity, the other to make humanity serve him. Gandhi, like Napoleon, harnessed the raw energies of nature; disciplined, mastered, and directed them with an unflinching will toward the achievement of one goal; and generated in the process an intensity of personality that inspired an entire nation and won the admiration of the whole world. These two great personalities differed mainly in the directions their souls pursued for self-realization.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Personality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Individual and corporate personality are constituted in much the same way. Both are living forces characterized by energy and direction. Direction in the individual is determined by the dominant values, motives, and goals that constitute the core of personality that psychologists call the self or psyche. Each corporation has a psychic center, too, which consists of the beliefs, values, mission, attitudes, and objectives that determine its long-term direction and short-term goals. Its organizational structure and hierarchy of authority act, like character and will in the individual, to harness the available energies and direct them in pursuit of the company&rsquo;s aims and objectives. Its systems, like the temperamental traits in the individual, are the channels through which the energies flow and the habitual ways in which the organization responds to recurring situations. Its skills are the means by which it refines the energies and expresses them in well-measured and precise actions. All these things together&mdash;beliefs, values, mission, attitudes, objectives, structure, authority, systems, and skills&mdash;are components of the corporate personality, which also possesses a physical body, consisting of the facilities, machinery, and other assets at its disposal.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As in the individual, the effectiveness of the corporate personality depends upon the extent to which energies are released by some powerful centralized motive or goal, harnessed by the organization, clearly focused in a given direction, disciplined by authority, expressed through coordinated and integrated systems with the necessary skills, and thereby converted into a controlled intensity for constructive action. The more developed and integrated the corporate personality is, then the higher are the values and goals it aspires to, the more powerful the energies it releases and harnesses, the more effective its control and direction of those energies, the greater its coordination of activities and skill in their execution, and the more powerful the intensity it manifests in work. The corporate personality is the most important person in the life of an organization&mdash;the person we alluded to in the previous chapter. The corporate personality holds the key to the process of converting energy into intensity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Companies, like individuals, vary enormously in the quality of their personalities. We are all familiar with one great corporate personality that looms large today on the American scene&mdash;a vigorous, assertive hero to respect and admire, a giant tower of strength and self-discipline, a protective parent to its friends, an awesome opponent to competitors, as systematic and methodical as the machines it makes, of prodigious intelligence and varied skills, with an indomitable persistence and consistency, prudent and thoughtful, ambitious without limit, exuding confidence and inspiring trust, hard-driving, persuasive, and practical&mdash;Big Blue, the spirit and substance of IBM.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By contrast, the best way we can characterize the personality of Delta is as a happy southern country family. A warm friendliness and wholesome feeling permeate the atmosphere at Delta. There is an abiding sense of security and acceptance. There is strong pride, but it is not arrogant or assertive&mdash;a family pride based on loyalty and a sense of belonging. There is a simplicity and thrift&mdash;the executive briefing room is furnished with molded lounge chairs removed from Convair aircraft 20 years ago&mdash;yet no sense of deprivation or asceticism. There is an informality that masks but cannot conceal a high level of skill and professional competence. There is a keen practical intelligence, free of pretensions but perceptive and shrewd, that only rural folk possess. There is a deeply rooted work ethic, intense energy, and an unceasing drive for higher performance motivated by a commitment and dedication to people.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Individual and the Corporation</span></p><a id="id.pix9pog3ko4w"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The kinship between individual and corporate personality is more than just an analogy. It is a symbiotic relationship. Hal Geneen, former CEO of the ITT Corporation, observed, &quot;All organizations, large and small, &hellip; reflect the personality and character of the man or men who lead them. The chief executive establishes the personality of the whole company.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><a id="id.t3avp0vgstih"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Usually it is the founder&rsquo;s personality that is the dominant influence. A vice-president of IBM once said of Tom Watson, Sr., &quot;His personality and force have saturated &hellip; IBM until now the personality of the man and the personality of the corporation are so closely identified as to be practically one and the same.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;IBM&rsquo;s enormous energy, high intelligence, limitless ambition, strict self-discipline, serious demeanor, tough and driving nature, methodical approach, premier marketing skill, conservative social values, and sober and conventional conduct are direct reflections of its patriarchal founder&rsquo;s personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Psychologists tell us that personality is a product of many influences&mdash;biological, familial, social, educational, environmental, and experiential. Geography and timing certainly played a significant role in the development of Delta. Delta was founded in Monroe, Louisiana, in 1928. Monroe was located near the vast cotton fields of the Mississippi Valley, which served as the market for Delta&rsquo;s original business as an aerial crop duster, and the company has never fully lost the rural flavor of it origins. Delta&rsquo;s first commercial flight was in June 1929, just months prior to the crash on Wall Street. The strained financial conditions of those early years undoubtedly contributed much to its proverbial cost-consciousness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But the personality of C. E. Woolman probably had much more to do with it than the Great Depression. Woolman came from a Scottish Presbyterian background and had a passion for thrift and efficiency that was legendary. Assistant Vice-President Clint Sweazea still types on a 50-year-old black Underwood and fondly refers to Woolman&rsquo;s resistance to purchasing new typewriters. Woolman believed in spending lavishly on the customer and airplane maintenance but sparingly on everything else&mdash;a tradition Delta continues to this day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Thrift was only a small part of Woolman&rsquo;s legacy to the personality of Delta. The founder bestows not only ideas and values on the company but also his or her ways of dealing with people and exercising authority. Woolman was a big, broad-faced, good-natured man with a homespun manner reminiscent of Will Rogers. He was hearty, outgoing, and gracious in public but quiet and humble in private&mdash;a description equally appropriate to a company known for its warm in-flight hospitality to the customer and unassuming management style at home. Woolman was fond of affecting an innocent, gullible, country-boy manner that veiled a shrewd mind and an inexhaustible ambition. The same informal manner, keen shrewdness, and incessant urge to excel characterize the company today.</span></p><a id="id.99d16wbjiubc"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The founder influences the corporate personality not only by his or her own traits but also by the type of people the founder recruits as subordinates. Woolman recruited individuals like himself&mdash;hearty, open, unassuming, and hardworking. Even today you could hardly mistake a Coca-Cola</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><a id="id.jnv96h92zgf4"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;executive for one from Delta&mdash;they are people of different casts. Woolman worked incessantly but told others to spend their weekends at home. His preoccupation with the safety and welfare of his employees won their loyalty and dedication to the company, released their energies and enthusiasm, and resulted in the creation of a friendly, secure, and highly productive work environment, where there has never been a strike or a significiant layoff. In the words of corporate biographers Lewis and Newton, &quot;In a paternalistic tradition already well established in the South, Delta became not simply a business corporation but something of an extended family as well.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><a id="id.f8txe772ilsb"></a></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Southern Aristocrat</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In some cases it is not the founder, but subsequent leaders with greater vision and more developed personalities who mold the corporation and leave the stamp of their personalities upon it. Such an individual was Robert Woodruff, the grand old patriarch of Coca-Cola, who headed the company from 1923 to 1955 and was chiefly responsible for its growth into a multinational, worldwide phenomenon.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Across town from Delta at the headquarters of Coca-Cola, we felt we were in the presence of a wealthy, aristocratic southern plantation owner with strong ties to the nobility of Europe. The luxurious executive offices&mdash;which one journal referred to as a &quot;southern mansion,&quot; with elegant high-backed chairs, plush carpets, spiral wooden stair-cases, and oil paintings on every wall&mdash;contributed something to this feeling; but it went far deeper than the decor. Carlton Curtis, assistant vice-president for corporate communications, explained: &quot;The overall culture and style of a southern institution is far more European than it is northeastern. The best analogy is the one of the duck floating placidly on the water, looking so serene and gentle, until you look underneath the water and see its feet beating away. It is part of the culture here that everything is more genteel and gentlemanly.&quot; Coca-Cola is polished, gracious and charming, sophisticated and formal&mdash;staff members button their jackets just to walk through the executive floor here, while at Delta they come in shirt sleeves to meet the president. Coca-Cola is cosmopolitan and conservative, honest, patient and reliable, extremely intelligent, highly professional, a stickler for quality, private, but still dynamic despite its long history of supremacy in the world of soft drinks. There is somehow an incongruity in this unusual blend of aristocracy and soft drinks that is reinforced by the custom of serving paper cups full of Coke in elegant surroundings, where one might rather expect crystal glasses full of champagne.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">From the beginning Coca-Cola was characteristically southern. The product was invented by an Altanta patent-medicine maker, Dr. John Pemberton, a century ago, with its successive owners all having deep southern roots. Back in 1931 </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><a id="id.lyq879xqf5bu"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;commented facetiously that &quot;The Pause That Refreshes&quot; was ideally suited to the South because &quot;The Southerner exhibits an inexhaustible capacity for pausing and an equally inexhaustible capacity for being refreshed.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c3">The aura of an aristocratic plantation owner can be traced back to Robert Woodruff, the son of a wealthy financier and the grandson of a self-made nineteenth-century millionaire, who bought a 30,000-acre plantation in southern Georgia for hunting and recreation about the same time he took over as president of Coca-Cola.</span></p><a id="id.j4gf5k8ew567"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Woodruff was known as &quot;Mr. Anonymous,&quot; always putting Coca-Cola in the limelight and himself behind. He was a vigorous, energetic, robust man, always very private and reserved, a man of few words, who had a warm personality and a good sense of humor. &quot;Laugh with others, laugh at yourself, don&rsquo;t let anything get you down.&quot; There was nothing very exceptional about him, other than his exceptional success. One of his successors as president, who saw the company as a reflection of Woodruff&rsquo;s personality, described him about 35 years ago: &quot;Bob has no particular talents. He&rsquo;s not a technical man or an advertising man. He is fumbling in his talk, and when he tells you something&rsquo;s wrong and you ask him what, he simply can&rsquo;t explain, though he nearly always turns out to have been right. But he has an ability for finding good men and for binding them to him, for developing in them an extraordinarily deep sense of loyalty. I am dedicated to Woodruff as to no other man alive.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Although Woodruff did not assume charge at Coca-Cola until it was more than 50 years old and handed over the reigns to his successor 30 years ago, his influence was alive in company affairs at the time of his death in early 1985. &quot;His presence is still very much felt,&quot; Coca-Cola President Don Keough said a few months before Woodruff&rsquo;s death. &quot;If you look around at the worldwide Coke system, his stamp is still on the system. It is a very real one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coca-Cola&rsquo;s perennial dynamism derives partly from the energetic line of entrepreneurs in the Woodruff family and partly from the present and relentless efforts of Pepsico, Inc. to overtake the leader. But there is another driving force behind Coca-Cola&rsquo;s century of continuous growth to become a $7 billion a year enterprise&mdash;the product itself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For decades the enormous popularity of the drink was as surprising and inexplicable to the company&rsquo;s owners as to anyone else. A mystique grew up around the product, since no one was really sure whether it was the drink itself, or the shape of the 6&frac12;-ounce bottle, or the tradename, or a combination of them all that was responsible.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coke established an image of quality and an aura of mysterious appeal that enabled it to withstand the onslaught of more than 1,000 competitive products&mdash;most of them lower-priced imitations&mdash;that attempted to make inroads on its domain. Somewhat on a parallel with King Midas, everyone who touched Pemberton&rsquo;s secret formula turned to gold (except the inventor himself, who sold it for $2,300). Coke has made untold numbers of shareholders, bottlers, and distributors rich beyond their dreams.</span></p><a id="id.govrno1udr3"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coke was once described as &quot;a sublimated essence of all that America stands for, a decent thing, honestly made, universally distributed, conscientiously improved with the years.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;But today Coke represents more than just America. This is the century of the common people. All over the world people have emerged from centuries of hard labor and suffering with a passionate aspiration for success, leisure, and enjoyment. Coke is &quot;the common people&rsquo;s champagne&quot;&mdash;refreshing, pleasant, and affordable. In every country where it is sold, it is identified as a symbol of the values of that nation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One executive described Coke&rsquo;s personality this way: &quot;In my view the personality is the American flag in America. In Brazil it is the Brazilian flag. In Argentina it is the Argentine flag. The world owns Coca-Cola. One time some visitors from a foreign country who had never been outside their country came into Atlanta, and they said, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve got Coca-Cola too!&rsquo; It is a symbol of what is good and growing in each country.&quot; In fact, Coca-Cola is an even more dominant force overseas. It controls from 40 percent to 70 percent of the carbonated soft drink market in most the countries where it is sold&mdash;in Japan the figure is 67 percent&mdash;compared to its 38 percent market share in the United States. As </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><a id="id.bsptzzfg9jz9"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;wrote 50 years ago, &quot;Coca-Cola is not so much a drink as an institution.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Coke has become a symbol of the better life in an age when people everywhere are moving up. As Woodruff liked to say, it is &quot;the people&rsquo;s drink.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The symbolic identification of the product with humanity&rsquo;s aspirations is a key to the personality of Coca-Cola and its phenomenal success. &quot;There is an absolute fascination that people have with Coca-Cola,&quot; says Keough. &quot;It is a sort of mystique which surrounds this particular product. That name, </span><span class="c2">Coca-Cola</span><span class="c3">, has somehow penetrated the psyche of hundreds of millions of people around the world.&quot; Doug Ivester, one of the few finance people we met who spoke more about other things than about money, said, &quot;The Coca-Cola business is a little bit of a religion.&quot; Coca-Cola&rsquo;s chairman insists, &quot;It&rsquo;s more than a religion. The people here have Coca-Cola in their veins instead of red blood.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During our visit to Coca-Cola, we were frequently reminded of another company three thousand miles away that belongs at a dramatically opposite end of the product spectrum&mdash;Apple. What could a hundred-year-old soft drink manufacturer and an eight-year-old computer maker possibly have in common?&mdash;A streak of mysticism. On hearing us repeat Sue Espinosa&rsquo;s comment that &quot;Apple is a cult,&quot; one Coca-Cola executive replied, &quot;Well, when they grow up, they can become a religion, too.&quot; For all their differences, we came away with the conclusion that Apple is in some essential respect a younger version of Coca-Cola, appealing to the deeper aspirations of people in a new age in much the same way as Coca-Cola has done since the beginning of the century.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coke addressed people&rsquo;s need for relaxation and enjoyment, for relief from the nervous stress and the straining pace of modern life. Apple addressed a deeper psychological need in society. In an age when people are in danger of becoming mechanized by the impersonal machine, Apple has humanized the machine and made it not only personal but personable as well. Apple has converted the machine from a de-humanizing threat into a source of enjoyment. Apple&rsquo;s biggest strength is its identification with a fundamental need of modern society, which opens up to a company the possibility of endless expansion. Such needs and possibilities exist in every field and can be served by any company&mdash;no matter how small it may be&mdash;that has the vision to perceive them.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Changing the Corporation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Coca-Cola introduced its new low-calorie soft drink in 1982, it broke with a hundred-year-old tradition by attaching its precious trade name to another product for the first time and called it Diet Coke. The same year, the company ventured into an entirely new industry with its acquisition of Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. Then, in April 1985, Coca-Cola astonished American business by changing the secret formula of the world&rsquo;s largest-selling soft drink.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These moves have been labeled by outsiders as evidence of a dramatic change in Coca-Cola&rsquo;s corporate culture. A Merrill Lynch analyst said that Chairman Roberto Goizueta has &quot;transformed Coca-Cola.&quot; </span><span class="c2">Beverage Digest</span><a id="id.rcxnjdeybjdm"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;described it as &quot;an extraordinary metamorphosis.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">International Management</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;ran a cover story on the shake-up in Coca-Cola&rsquo;s corporate culture.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Does a change of product or entrance into a new field really reflect a fundamental change in the character of an organization? When an individual changes jobs, his or her dress and actions may change&mdash;the person may shift from being a tax collector to running an orphanage&mdash;but the individual&rsquo;s basic personality remains the same. Changes in product line are more like the annual model changes at Detroit. The appearance and price are different, but the engine and the chassis remain pretty much the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Roberto Goizueta has no illusions about it. He loves to point out the degree to which things at Coca-Cola remain exactly the same. &quot;I think that the idea of a new Coca-Cola company has been overplayed in the press. We have the same strengths today that we had ten years ago.&quot; To him, the company&rsquo;s diversification into pictures is a logical extension of a process that began in the early 1950s. Coca-Cola has always been a company that excelled in marketing images, and that is precisely the business Columbia Pictures is in. The entertainment industry provides relaxation and enjoyment for the mind, as Coke does for the nerves. When Goizueta first discussed the idea of entering the entertainment field with Woodruff 3&frac12; years ago, the 92-year-old man replied, &quot;If I were 50 years old today &hellip; this is precisely the sort of thing I would be doing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People frequently change their opinions, their behavior, sometimes even the values and beliefs they espouse, but their personalities remain essentially unchanged. The same is true of companies. Psychologists have always been leery of sudden conversions, because they usually prove quite superficial and temporary. Permanent changes are most often very gradual and rarely radical. This, of course, does not mean that people and companies do not change. They are constantly changing. But deep-rooted changes are not brought about merely by a change in the goals top managment seeks, the strategies it adopts, or the actions it initiates. A company&rsquo;s personality is rooted in every one of its beliefs, values, and attitudes; in its structure; in the way it motivates and controls people; in its systems; in the type of people it recruits; in the way it trains them; in its relationship with suppliers, customers, and shareholders; and in the products or services it markets. Management can and must act to constantly modify, and hopefully improve, functioning in all these areas. In the short run, it can motivate people to work hard through greater rewards or greater discipline, it can shuffle managers or fire them, it can reorganize divisions and enter new fields, it can buy or sell subsidiaries&mdash;but none of these actions necessarily has a deep and lasting impact on the basic personality of the company. Institutions do not evolve by themselves. They need leaders who extend and widen their vision, who release and mobilize their energies, and help them evolve. The challenge faced by all leaders is whether their personalities are going to imprint a greater vision, dynamism, discipline, and expansiveness on the personalities of the organizations they guide in order to foster company growth, or whether the company is going to impose its own personality on the leader in order to preserve its present character.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Great Dame</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most dramatic example of a sudden, radical change in the life of a major corporation was brought about by the breakup of the Bell System at the end of 1983. Until that time, AT&amp;T was the largest corporation in the history of the world and the greatest corporate personality of them all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Each of us has felt the presence of that personality in our own lives. She has been a mother to us all&mdash;kind, attentive, courteous to a fault, rich in talent, laden with skills, huge beyond conception but not overbearing, wealthy beyond calculation but not snobbish, confident of her strength and knowledge and capacity but neither arrogant nor vain: Ma Bell&mdash;for 107 years, the heart and soul of AT&amp;T.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">AT&amp;T&rsquo;s personality was a natural product of the kind of people who guided its early development, the field of the company&rsquo;s activity, and the business environment of the day. When Alexander Graham Bell filed his patent application for the telephone in 1876, several other men were working on similar inventions, and it has never been clearly established whose was the first. But Bell and Gardiner Hubbard, who organized the original Bell Telephone Company, were the first to devise the system for utilizing this invention that has subsequently been adopted throughout the world. At that time, the only model available was the telegraph system devised by Western Union Corporation. But Bell had an even more ambitious system in mind. He envisioned installation of phones in every home and office in the country and gathering the local lines at local offices, which would be interconnected by cables. Hubbard knew that financing such a system would be impossible, so he conceived the plan of selling franchises to local telephone companies, which would raise their own capital, use the Bell patents, and pay royalties to the Bell company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It was Theodore Vail who drew up a program to create a national telephone system interlinking all the local companies by providing long-distance services between them. AT&amp;T was incorporated in 1885 as a separate company with Vail as its first president. Vail also proposed to affiliate local companies with the Bell organization by exchanging equity with them. In 1907 the various Bell companies were consolidated under AT&amp;T, and Vail assumed leadership of the new firm. In the structure that emerged, a highly centralized parent organization controlled many regional operating companies on which it imposed common values, objectives, policies, standards, strategies, and behavior.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Just at the time of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s emergence as the dominant force in the industry, events were taking place that very powerfully influenced the development of the company&rsquo;s personality. It was a time of great public outrage against the ruthless, illegal, and corrupt practices of giant trusts like Standard Oil, culminating in the breakup of the Standard Trust under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Vail was keenly aware that in order to survive, a corporation had to do much more than just amass huge profits; it also had to be accepted and valued by the community, which the Standard Trust never was. He perceived service, not profit, as the guiding mission of AT&amp;T and established as the corporate credo, &quot;One system, one policy, universal service.&quot; His idea was to make AT&amp;T a monopoly that would not behave as if it were one&mdash;a &quot;publicly owned but privately managed institution,&quot; as one of his successors phrased it. Instead of using its position to extort greater profits from the public, Vail strove to distribute the benefits of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s size by giving lower phone rates to the company&rsquo;s customers. Instead of concentrating ownership in the hands of a few, he succeeded in creating a very broad-based ownership. He also established a steady dividend policy in bad as well as good years to make the stock attractive to small shareholders as a lifetime investment that could be passed on to their descendants. He wanted the company to be perceived as a good neighbor and succeeded so well that while the public had angrily demanded the breakup of Standard, it hailed AT&amp;T as a responsible corporate citizen and Vail as an enlightened entrepreneur. Ma Bell became the ultimate symbol of a benevolent corporation working in and for the public interest.</span></p><a id="id.3sljzrxw1tif"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The personality of AT&amp;T was strongly influenced by the personalities of the individuals who founded it. Most of them were wealthy Bostonian aristocrats. Hubbard was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and founder of the National Geographic Society. AT&amp;T&rsquo;s conservative, respectable image undoubtedly had its roots in the cultured background from which it sprang. Vail was an outgoing and open man, who moved smoothly with others, freely delegating authority. He was the first of a new breed of managers who helped create the style of the modern corporate executive. Up to that time, it had been common to view the company as merely an extension of the individual who founded it. But Vail believed the founder is there to serve the company and willingly subordinate himself or herself to its interests. Vail was certainly ambitious, but he knew the limits of power, was sensitive to the growing public concern over big business, and voluntarily curtailed AT&amp;T&rsquo;s expansion, restricting it from entry into several related fields. He was a cautious man. &quot;I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, but I am afraid of them.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;From Vail, AT&amp;T acquired both the thrust for expansion and the prudent self-restraint that have sustained it over the decades.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The rapid and continuous expansion of the U.S. telephone system throughout the first half of the twentieth century generated a constant need for additional employees and qualified managers trained in the Bell organization. Employment security, lifetime careers, and promotion from within naturally followed from this situation and imbued the corporate personality with the characteristics of a secure and accepting mother. &quot;You know, you can laugh about &lsquo;Ma Bell&rsquo; and that sort of thing,&quot; said Brooke Tunstall, corporate vice-president, organization and management systems, &quot;but nobody ever felt that their job was in jeopardy. This benign protector, the thing called Ma Bell, made people feel secure. A workplace was created where the interest of the individual could be sublimated to the interests of the company, because people felt secure.&quot; When Tunstall appeared for a job interview at one of the Bell operating companies in 1948, he was so overwhelmed by the friendliness and cheerfulness of everyone he met that he said to himself, &quot;I&rsquo;d work for this company for nothing.&quot; The same atmosphere pervaded the entire system from coast to coast. AT&amp;T evolved into a harmonious environment characterized by highly disciplined people working in an atmosphere of trust and committed to &quot;something that was a little larger than the company.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a regulated company, AT&amp;T was freed from many of the pressures of the competitive marketplace. Yet it still was able to operate the cheapest and most efficient telephone system in the world. It did this by encouraging internal competition between 20 Bell operating companies, which were evaluated and compared with each other every month on at least 100 specific measurements of productivity and quality of service.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The major characteristics of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s personality were closely linked to its stated mission of providing universal telephone service to all customers in the United States. The values it adopted, the attitudes it fostered, the organizational structure it created, the standardized systems it established, the uniform policies it enforced, the type of people it recruited, the skills it imparted through training, the internal atmosphere of coordination and teamwork it fostered between different departments and divisions and companies of the system, and the way it attuned itself to be in harmony with the needs of a changing society over nearly ten decades&mdash;all these were related to its mission of being the one company that provided all telephone services to practically every customer in the country.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Whatever Happened to Ma Bell?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the past few decades, dramatic changes in the environment have altered many of the external conditions under which AT&amp;T grew up. The development of computers and satellite communications eliminated the necessity of one telephone system to meet the needs of the entire country. AT&amp;T&rsquo;s corporate mission has become outdated. The breakup of the Bell System was the result.</span></p><a id="id.29rt0q5zf0eh"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">After divestiture, AT&amp;T has had to adjust to the shift from a regulated to a competitive environment. It has had to turn its attention away from interactions with regulatory agencies of the government to competition with other communications companies in the marketplace. Divestiture has necessitated a reformulation of corporate mission; a change in structure; a comprehensive review of corporate attitudes and policies toward employees, customers, and society.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><a id="id.ppq7gmeipn6e"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;These changes have generated shock waves of disturbance throughout the company as well as deep anxiety among employees and have helped to popularize Chairman Charles Brown&rsquo;s remark, &quot;Ma Bell doesn&rsquo;t live here anymore.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If ever there were a classic case of an organization&rsquo;s having to change its personality beyond all recognition, this is surely it. To those intimately involved in the process and sentimentally attached to the old AT&amp;T, the changes appear like mortal blows falling on a dear friend. But in reality, the core of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s personality remains intact. It still possesses a highly motivated, dedicated, and committed workforce, which is perhaps even more motivated than before. &quot;The energy level is higher,&quot; Tunstall observes. It still operates through the same communications network, though no longer exclusively anymore. It still possesses the most sophisticated industrial research laboratory in the world. It still possesses an impressive array of technical, managerial, organizational, and interpersonal skills. It is still one of the largest and wealthiest corporations in the world.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is true that AT&amp;T now faces heavy competition in the marketplace, that its assets are diminished, that its research budget is under far tighter constraints, and that is must acquire marketing skills that it did not possess earlier. But these things do not touch the core of the company&rsquo;s personality. It may be true that the culture at AT&amp;T is changing from a care-taking, secure environment to a more risk-taking, competitive one, but this is still a relatively superficial type of change. Culture is only a way of living and acting. Personality is the being that lives and acts, and the corporate personality remains essentially intact. Ma Bell still lives at AT&amp;T.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Twenty-five years ago Frederick Kappel, then president of AT&amp;T, wrote a book entitled </span><span class="c2">Vitality in a Business Enterprise</span><a id="id.9nyljqvvnwmx"></a><span class="c3">. He defined vitality as &quot;the power a business generates today that will assure its success and progress tomorrow.&quot; What makes a vital business? &quot;Vital people make it. &hellip; It is not to be found in things, in machines, or dollars, or material resources of any kind. Vitality is something people demonstrate through sustained competence; through creative, venturesome drive; and through a strong feeling of ethical responsibility, which means an inner need to do what is right and not just what one is required to do.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Certainly AT&amp;T still possesses all those attributes today.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">AT&amp;T&rsquo;s greatest strength lies in its highly skilled and dedicated workforce, its ability to put service to the customer ahead of profitability as a corporate priority, and its capacity to identify with the larger national interests of the country. These are the roots of its historical growth and its incredible accomplishments. They remain intact. If only the top management does not abandon the company&rsquo;s greatest strengths by casting off what is of lasting value in the process of shedding outmoded attitudes, policies, and structures, then Ma Bell is virtually assured of a future as impressive and accomplished as her past.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Conclusion</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.v9cz9kml6te"><span class="c3">Corporations are as varied in their personalities as people are. Yet all successful corporations release, harness, direct, and convert human energy into corporate intensity through one or more of the powers of personality. It may be through the power of discipline, like Intel; through systems and skills, like IBM; through cooperation and loyalty, like Delta; through service, like AT&amp;T; through harmony with a social need, like Apple and Coca-Cola; or through any combination of these powers. The powers of corporate personality are not the monopoly of the large and successful. All of these companies had small, entrepreneurial beginnings&mdash;Coca-Cola 100 years ago, Apple in 1977. They have reached their current status because these powers are present in every organization, though often unseen and untapped. Companies that mobilize one or more of them surpass others in the field and establish a record of enduring success.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 3 - The Heart of the Matter</span></h1><p class="c39"><span class="c3">Alice went on, &quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to walk from here?&quot; <br>&quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,&quot; said the Cat. <br>&quot;I don&rsquo;t much care where,&quot; said Alice. <br>&quot;Then it doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you walk,&quot; said the Cat.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c3">&mdash;Lewis Carrol</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy and direction are the primary attributes of personality. Energy comes from willpower and effort. Direction comes from ideas. Ideas inspire. They possess the power to release energy and channel it in a creative direction. There are several types of ideas that give direction to a company and constitute the core of its personality, its psychic center. These ideas include the beliefs, values, mission, goals, objectives, and attitudes that influence its thoughts, guide its decisions, mold its policies, and determine the course of its actions. The psychic center consists of those ideas that actually influence corporate behavior.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is a tale from the </span><span class="c2">Arabian Nights</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;entitled &quot;Barmecide&rsquo;s Feast,&quot; about a prince who decided to amuse himself by inviting a beggar to an imaginary feast of words. The beggar was led into a grand dining hall laden with ornately decorated covered dishes. The prince went around the table describing each dish in mouth-watering terms one by one before uncovering the empty plates. The beggar eventually caught on to the prank and pretended to eat and drink from the empty dishes. Feigning drunkenness, he then got up, stumbled across the room, and punched his host in the face.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It has become fashionable these days for some companies to publicize idealistic statements of corporate philosophy, which are essentially feasts of words. This has evoked a natural and justifiable response of skepticism and cynicism from many people who are reluctant to assume that a company&rsquo;s pronouncements necessarily reflect its intentions. The relationship between words and deeds is the crux of the issue. To what extent do a company&rsquo;s stated beliefs actually determine the way it acts?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">An Extraordinary Act</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When a man died of gunshot wounds, the coroner&rsquo;s investigation found that it was a case of suicide. The man had taken out a Northwestern Mutual life insurance policy, which did not provide coverage in the event of suicidal death. But Northwestern Mutual was not quite satisfied by the coroner&rsquo;s report and decided to launch an investigation of its own. The company concluded that there was a reasonable doubt about whether it was a case of suicide and paid the full value of the policy to the deceased man&rsquo;s family.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Why on earth would a company act contrary to its own financial interests when law had freed it of any possible liability? Such acts, numbering in the hundreds, maybe thousands, are characteristic of Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s personality. They are expressions of the company&rsquo;s mission, which is stated in a corporate credo dating back to 1888: &quot;The ambition of the Northwestern has been less to be large than to be safe; its aim is to rank first in benefits to policyholders rather than first in size.&quot; In practice, this means that the company is highly selective in underwriting new policies but extremely liberal in awarding benefits even under doubtful circumstances. A century-old credo, a simple idea, charts the company&rsquo;s course of action. But there are still questions that remain unanswered: Why? Who? and How? Why does a company adopt idealistic values and then seek to follow them? Who determines a company&rsquo;s guiding values? How are the values actually translated into action?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Testing Values in a Crisis</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is an old proverb that says, &quot;Thought is the soul of act.&quot; Ideas determine decisions; decisions dictate actions. There are virtually hundreds of ideas that influence the behavior of a corporation. The impact of ideas depends on their inherent validity, the extent to which management is committed to them, and the level at which they are implemented. A real test of an individual&rsquo;s or a company&rsquo;s commitment to an idea is the way it behaves during a crisis.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Such a crisis descended on Johnson &amp; Johnson in the fall of 1982 when seven people died in Chicago of cyanide poisoning after consuming extra-strength Tylenol capsules. A company whose products had become a byword for quality, gentleness, and the finest in health care for nearly a century was suddenly associated in the minds of millions with the very antithesis of the values it had tried to embody. At stake was a $400 million a year product and the reputation of one of America&rsquo;s most respected companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Tylenol began its rise to fame around 1975, when Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s McNeil Consumer Division began aggressively marketing the product as an alternative to aspirin. In what </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><a id="id.z7f9soqsccd8"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;termed &quot;one of the headiest success stories in the last decade,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Tylenol had captured 35 percent of the $1.2 billion market for analgesic drugs by 1982, contributing 7 percent to Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s worldwide sales and 15 percent to 20 percent to its profits. When news of the poisonings broke out, Johnson &amp; Johnson was faced with innumerable decisions that had to be made by management on the spur of the moment under the glare of nationwide media coverage. From the beginning of the crisis, the company opened its doors to the media in recognition of its responsibility to keep the public fully informed of the events. The major issue concerned 31 million bottles of extra-strength Tylenol capsules that were on drugstore shelves around the country. It soon became evident that the cyanide had been introduced into the capsules only after they had reached the stores and that the problem was localized in the Chicago area. Nevertheless, news of the poisonings had reached the entire country, and a wave of fear hit drug consumers everywhere. Tylenol sales plummeted to 20 percent of their previous level, and opinion polls revealed that 61 percent of Tylenol users would probably never buy the product again. Madison Avenue marketing experts predicted that the product would never recover.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The FBI and the Food and Drug Administration counseled Johnson &amp; Johnson not to take any precipitous action. Despite that advice, Johnson &amp; Johnson decided to immediately recall the 31 million bottles of Tylenol at a cost of $100 million. The company&rsquo;s second major decision was made a few weeks later&mdash;to relaunch the product in triple-sealed, tamperproof packages. Contrary to the consensus of the experts, within a year the product had regained 90 percent of its previous market share.</span></p><a id="id.z9z2ednz5kic"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Looking back on the events, Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s president, David R. Clare, remarked: &quot;Crisis planning did not see us through this tragedy nearly as much as the sound business management philosophy that is embodied in our credo. It was the credo that prompted the decisions that enabled us to make the right early decisions that eventually led to the comback phase.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><a id="id.7jvpdzcp8afy"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;Chairman James E. Burke confirmed that &quot;the guidance of the credo played the most important role&quot; in the company&rsquo;s decision making.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Johnson &amp; Johnson&rsquo;s credo, which was written by General Robert Wood Johnson 40 years ago, is based on two central beliefs. The general expressed the first of them in these words:</span></p><a id="id.l0y8x81h8n9d"></a><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Institutions, both public and private, exist because the people want them, believe in them, or at least are willing to tolerate them. The day has passed when business was a private matter&mdash;if it ever really was. In a business society, every act of business has social consequences and may arouse public interest. Every time business hires, builds, sells or buys, it is acting for the &hellip; people as well as for itself, and it must be prepared to accept full responsibility.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">From this belief arose the text of the credo, which sums up the responsibility of the company to its customers, employees, the community, and its shareholders. It states that the company&rsquo;s &quot;</span><span class="c2">first responsibility</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is to the doctors, nurses and patients, to mothers and all others who use our products and services.&quot; On the basis of this belief, the company felt the obligation to withdraw $100 million of product from the market&mdash;not only to eliminate even the slightest possibility of any further poisonings but also to alleviate the widespread anxiety arising from the events. It acted to protect the public&rsquo;s safety and also to bolster the public&rsquo;s emotional security.</span></p><a id="id.qk8mw2ow03mu"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The second belief on which the credo was based is that paying attention to social responsibilities is beneficial to business. Burke said, &quot;I have long harbored the belief that the most successful corporations in this country, the ones that have delivered outstanding results over a long period of time, were driven by a simple moral imperative&mdash;serving the public in the broadest possible sense better than their competition.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;To the management of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the unexpected recovery of Tylenol is a vindication of that belief.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The company&rsquo;s actions during the crisis won the confidence of the public. One poll taken three months after the tragedy showed that 93 percent of the people felt the firm had handled its responsibilities well. It also won accolades from the press. </span><span class="c2">The Wall Street Journal</span><a id="id.58cejmatxk85"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;wrote of it: &quot;Without being asked, it quickly withdrew extra-strength Tylenol from the market at a very considerable expense. The company chose to take a large loss rather than expose anyone to further risk.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Winning the confidence of people is not merely a question of convincing their minds that you have done the right thing; you must convince their feelings, too. A clear understanding does not create as much confidence as a satisfied feeling. Johnson &amp; Johnson succeeded in providing both.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Bitter Truth</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">On the night of March 1, 1984, the lights were burning a little brighter than usual at the New York headquarters of </span><span class="c2">The Wall Street Journal</span><span class="c3">. A news story was about to break, and the editorial staff was carefully examining the facts as they came in, sifting substance from rumor, trying to arrive at the truth. The largest-selling newspaper in America, published by one of the most admired companies in the country, which over the last ten years has earned an average 26.3 percent return on equity (second best in the United States), a close observer of the business world, a relentless seeker after the secrets of corporate failure and success&mdash;perhaps the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;has learned more from watching others than it reveals to its readers. Its appeal is not the alluring excitement of sensationalism and scandal but, rather, authoritative and factual reporting backed by integrity, reliability, and a commitment to the highest ethical standards of journalism.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But on this particular occasion, the big story </span><span class="c2">was</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a scandal, and the subject of investigation was the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;itself. That day the Securities and Exchange Commission had notified the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that one of its reporters for the &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; column, R. Foster Winans, was under informal investigation for periodically leaking market-sensitive information to a stock trader that may have affected trading in the shares of 21 companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At stake was the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s most precious possession&mdash;its reputation for integrity and impartiality. It had to make a difficult choice&mdash;to chase after the story and reveal all of the facts or to hide behind the screen of legal precedents that provide journalists with a certain degree of immunity from public scrutiny. The </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;made its decision immediately. The next morning it came out with a feature article on market leaks, in which it disclosed the SEC investigation of Winans. A few weeks later, after the first round of investigations was over, it published a front-page article headlined &quot;Stock Scandal&quot; in which it revealed all available information on Winans and the investigation. Meanwhile, Winans had been fired.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The extent of the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&rsquo;s openness and cooperation with the SEC evoked both praise and anxiety from other newspapers. An editor of </span><span class="c2">The Washington Post</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was quoted as saying, &quot;The </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><a id="id.c35pcyomuyqy"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;has done a fine job of reporting the story.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c3">A </span><span class="c2">New York Times</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;columnist suggested that the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;may have actually been too open, when it provided even personal records and reporters&rsquo; notes to the SEC. &quot;Does the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><a id="id.v13sacquicsb"></a><span class="c3">&rsquo;s cooperation with the SEC investigation jeopardize First Amendment guarantees of a free press?&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span class="c3">But the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;remained adamant in its decision to reveal all the facts. Dow Jones Chairman Warren Phillips explained the idea behind the </span><span class="c2">Journal</span><a id="id.60bdalccj2kk"></a><span class="c3">&rsquo;s actions: &quot;The only consideration in our coverage was what we owed our readers. We felt we had an obligation to give all the facts in precisely the same way we do when wrongdoing occurs at other institutions. &hellip; &quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These two incidents do not prove that companies always act in the public interest. But they do illustrate how a company&rsquo;s central beliefs give direction to the decisions and actions of top management during a crisis. Such crises are, of course, rare. Of more practical importance is the impact of a company&rsquo;s central ideas on its normal day-to-day functioning.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">An Honest Merchant</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One corporation that has become renowned for living up to its word is Sears. The most striking characteristics of Sears are its size and its plainness. With 798 retail stores and 2,389 catalog-sales centers, with 60 million Sears credit card holders representing half of all American families, with nearly 450,000 employees worldwide and almost $39 billion in annual sales, the company is gigantic and possessed of enormous reserves of vitality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Yet, in spite of its size, Sears is somehow very ordinary. The company is still grounded in the simple values and levelheaded common sense of middle America&rsquo;s rural heartland, and this is by far its greatest strength. As the corporate director of human resources, Mary Kay Kennedy, put it: &quot;We are about as U.S.A. America as anybody can be.&quot; Sears&rsquo; personality is rooted in values like utility, reliability, consistency, and worth. Its patient, unpretentious, nonaggressive demeanor has often misled people, especially sophisticated northeasterners, into seriously underestimating its capabilities and intelligence. But Sears is not lacking in either, as its remarkable history amply demonstrates and its present diversification into financial services will undoubtedly confirm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One thing nobody doubts about Sears is its integrity. Just before the turn of the century, Julius Rosenwald introduced a policy at Sears that was highly instrumental in the growth of the fledgling mail-order business into the largest retailer in the world. That policy, which can be found printed in bold letters above the front door of every Sears store in the country, reads &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back.&quot; There is nothing very high-sounding about this policy today, primarily because Sears popularized it so widely over the decades that most major department store chains have been forced to adopt something similar&mdash;at least in words, if not in practice. But in 1895 such an idea was far from common.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Rosenwald joined the company, he found that Richard Sears, the founder, had quite a penchant for poetic license in advertising his wares. At a time when the company was barely known outside of Chicago, Sears emblazoned the cover of his catalog with the modest claim: &quot;Cheapest Supply House on Earth. Our Trade Reaches Around the World.&quot; The catalog included obesity powders to get rid of superfluous fat and a hair restorer&mdash;hardly products any company would like to back by a guarantee. Rosenwald recognized that in order to win the confidence of conservative and skeptical farmers living in the rural areas, the catalog had to be factual. He curbed Sears&rsquo; literary impulses, introduced clear, factual descriptions of each product, and established the famed policy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The policy itself is based on two values&mdash;the value of trust and the value of reliability. It says, in effect, that Sears is a company you can trust because it sells reliable, quality merchandise. The idea of a trustworthy and reliable merchant is certainly appealing. But the power of the idea arises from the fact that it has been converted into a policy that is enforced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A few years ago a man walked into the Sears store at Wayne, New Jersey, with an old beer carton containing some five-to ten-year-old Craftsman tools and asked the service counter representative to replace them because they were rusty. The service representative called over the store manager, Bill Collett, to speak with the customer. The man explained that he had just moved to another house and in the basement he found these tools, which had obviously been abandoned by the previous owner of the house. He saw that they were Sears&rsquo; Craftsman tools, which he knew carried a lifetime guarantee. Since they had rusted, he had come in to exchange them. Collett was a little stupefied by the customer&rsquo;s request, but after ascertaining that the man was both serious and adamant, he exchanged the tools for new ones.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Hatchets with smashed heads that are sold with clear instructions not to use them as hammers, broken screwdrivers that have been used as crowbars, shoes that are nearly worn out, even furniture purchased six months earlier&mdash;all are brought back to the Wayne store for adjustment. Collett says that in 24 years he has never refused an adjustment to a customer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sears&rsquo; money-back guarantee is not just a policy enforced by the manager in extreme circumstances. It is communicated down the line from manager to the sales floor and to customer service as a guideline for everyone to follow. Mike Minetti, who had been working as a sales clerk at the Wayne store for only six months, could recall installing entire kitchens for customers exactly according to the specifications of a written contract and approved plan, then ripping them out and changing things around at no extra charge because the customer was not happy with the layout. &quot;The bottom line with Sears is that if the customer is not happy&mdash;even when the conditions of purchase are explicit and clear&mdash;satisfy him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Employees carry out the Sears policy even when they know the customer is taking unfair advantage of the company. Since the policy is clearly written above the door, there is no alternative but to comply. Kim Newburg, a college student and part-time customer-service representative at the Wayne store, says: &quot;The company wants us to make sure the customers are satisfied and they get whatever they need. &hellip; We take back almost anything, even if there is no receipt, even if it is the customer&rsquo;s fault. We take back clothing, even if it is a year old.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many companies have liberal return policies, but few have converted the ideas of trust and reliability into a living tradition that is transmitted from management to part-time hourly workers and translated into practice on a daily basis in stores all over the country. According to a recent article in </span><span class="c2">Time</span><a id="id.57gskiiowz6j"></a><span class="c3">, much of the positive feeling toward Sears even today is a result of this policy. &quot;Sears will take almost anything back, for almost any reason&quot; and &quot;sometimes get taken itself in the process of taking back goods. &hellip; At a time when many companies cannot resist the temptation to take the money and run, Sears continues to show how to succeed in business by really trying.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Edward Brennan, Sears&rsquo; president, explained the significance of the policy this way:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Most companies will be very quick to give the customer his money back on a $2 tie. If it&rsquo;s a $20 shirt, most retailers will be fairly quick to give the money back. If it&rsquo;s a $200 lawn mower, many companies will take care of that. If it is a $2,000 central air conditioner, then there are fewer that are going to be responsible. And if it is a $20,000 remodeling of a house, there are not very many </span><span class="c2">at all</span><span class="c3">. It is the principle of the thing. I&rsquo;ve never seen the profit and loss account of a store significantly impacted in a negative way by a liberal adjustment policy. It also brings in more customers, no question about it. It is the spirit that has created that reputation for integrity.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Pragmatic Idealist </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Johnson &amp; Johnson has a credo that guided the decisions of its top management during a crisis. Sears has a policy based on certain values, which it communicates to its employees and which serves as a guideline for their conduct in the day-to-day operation of the business. These are two different levels or expressions of value implementation. At Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, we found another.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Values were not the first thing we thought of when we visited MSD&rsquo;s facilities at West Point, Pennsylvania. There was a cool air of military discipline about the place as we struggled to pass through security and were rushed along to our first meeting. Merck has a strong, assertive personality, highly professional, hard-driving, very intelligent. It has a systematically organized character, undoubtedly a legacy from the company&rsquo;s founder, George Merck, whose family had run a pharmacy and drug-manufacturing business in Germany for more than two centuries prior to his move to the United States in 1891.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This first impression hardly prepared us for what we encountered during our meeting with John Lyons, a former president of MSD who has since been promoted to executive vice-president of Merck &amp; Company, Inc. In fact, we were quite taken aback as Lyons waxed eloquent on the value of integrity. He believes that the company&rsquo;s credibility with physicians is one of the most important factors in its success:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">The key to our productivity is our credibility. It can take years to build it, and it takes just an instant to destroy it. If the sales force asks what they should really be doing, I tell them: &quot;You should just make believe that your mother is the next patient to be diagnosed by the physician. How would you like the physician to be informed about the product? You want to make sure the physician understands when not to use the product; or if they are going to use it, you want to make sure that the side effects, if any, are understood by the patient.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Quite frankly, we did wonder for a while whether we were being treated to a Barmecide feast like the beggar. But all doubts were very soon dispelled. Lyons warned us not to take his word for it. What we discovered was that his obsession with credibility was only one expression of the company&rsquo;s preoccupation with integrity. At MSD credibility is not just an idea or even a policy. It is a value that has been converted into a top-priority goal to be pursued at every moment in every department at every level of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Credibility at MSD starts with training. The professional representatives who meet physicians to present information on new drugs are inculcated from the first day of training with the doctrine of &quot;fair balance.&quot; </span><span class="c2">Fair balance</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;means that the representative must present the strengths and the weaknesses of each product in an absolutely objective manner, with no exaggeration of positive claims about a drug and no understatement of its side effects. Eugene McCabe, vice-president of marketing, explained: &quot;From the very beginning we explain to the representative that it is in his or her interest and our interest and the patient&rsquo;s interest and the doctor&rsquo;s interest that we be very, very much aboveboard, that we present things in a balanced way, and then we drill them on this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Credibility begins with training, but it does not end there. The representatives are also evaluated monthly on the fair balance of their presentations to physicians, and this is one of the criteria for determining their performance ratings. A recent study by Scott-Levin Associates found that MSD&rsquo;s representatives scored highest among all major U.S. pharmaceuticals firms on the quality of their presentations to physicians.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">MSD also has a rigorous system for ensuring that all literature presented to the medical community passes the test of fair balance. Every single communication that is sent out of the company&mdash;including letters to physicians, sales bulletins to representatives, and prescribing information contained in the drug package&mdash;must first be cleared by one of the half-dozen medical-legal review boards, each consisting of a lawyer who reports to corporate headquarters and a physician who reports to the research division. Representatives are not even permitted to write out a note at the doctor&rsquo;s office containing any product information. &quot;That&rsquo;s strictly forbidden,&quot; says McCabe, because &quot;we must have trust among the medical profession that what we tell them is truthful and honest.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Maintaining and enhancing credibility at Merck is not just the responsibility of the review boards or the training department. It starts with the CEO and includes just about everybody. Every manager at Merck is responsible for preserving the image and credibility of the company and for everything that is done by those who work under him or her. Managers have to be informed and alert regarding every detail. &quot;Details are important in this business,&quot; says McCabe, &quot;because it is in the little details that you can get in trouble. It is little facts, over-looking little things, which can hurt patients.&quot; In addition to the responsibility of managers, there is also an intense peer pressure from colleagues to maintain the company&rsquo;s high standards.</span></p><a id="id.7kuhm0vxfjdm"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Merck does not have a high-sounding credo to draw inspiration from, but most people trace the origin of its insistence on integrity to the founder&rsquo;s son, George W. Merck, who became president of the company in 1925. Merck once said, &quot;We try to remember that medicine is for the patient. We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger they have been.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Those words were spoken in 1950. To what extent have they proved true since then? According to John Huck, chairman of Merck &amp; Company, Inc., &quot;every time.&quot; In the midsixties the firm started putting an extra emphasis on its obligation to the community and on fair balance. This coincided with a period of rapid growth that took the company from sixth in the industry to its present position as No. 1. As MSD&rsquo;s president, Doug MacMaster, put it: &quot;It made good sense to be ethical. To tell the full truth about your product makes you all the more believable. Our success in selling is really based on very good products and having tremendous credibility.&quot; The company&rsquo;s integrity has earned it not only the confidence of the doctors but the loyalty of its own employees as well. As one executive commented: &quot;It is very, very nice to work for a company in a marketing job where the underlying philosophy is to be as honest as you possibly can with the customer. That is a nice thing, because I think it is the right thing to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Value implementation at Merck is based on a lofty idea, to which top management has very seriously committed itself. This idea has been translated into a formal program that includes a clear statement of policy, explicit standards for conduct, training, and a series of systems designed to control, monitor, and evaluate behavior to ensure that it is consistent with the value. Responsibility for value implementation goes right down the line and is reinforced by pressure from peers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Safety Pays</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most powerful corporate values are not the ones that are preached and practiced by top management. They are the ones that penetrate through all the layers of the organization down to the bottom, where they are implicitly followed, often unconsciously.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Eleuth&egrave;re du Pont immigrated to America from revolutionary France in 1790, he had to abandon the property and privileges of his aristocratic past. But he did carry with him two valuable assets&mdash;a technology and an idea. The technology was for making the best gunpowder in the New World. Du Pont established a gunpowder factory alongside the Brandywine River at Wilmington, the seed for what is today the seventh largest industrial company and most admired chemicals producer in the United States. Du Pont&rsquo;s formula for gun-powder is no longer valuable, since the company left that business long ago; but the idea he brought along with it is more valuable than ever before.</span></p><a id="id.tgluu521wmm8"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">His idea is summed up in the philosophy of E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, Inc.: &quot;We will not produce any product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;That philosophy expresses a very lofty idea even by today&rsquo;s standards. But it is absolutely incredible to think that it originated 200 years ago from a manufacturer of gunpowder, especially in the days when powder mills had the nasty habit of blowing to smithereens now and then.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Du Pont started a safety tradition at his powder mill that has long outlived its founder or the mill and become a core value of the company. He designed his first powder mills to minimize the danger in the event of an explosion. He tested new gunpowder formulations himself before permitting other employees to handle them. He established a rule that no employee was allowed to enter a new mill until he or his general manager had first operated it safely. But more than all these precautions, he demonstrated his commitment to safety by living with his family on the plant site beside the mills along with his employees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Two hundred years later Du Pont&rsquo;s safety record is truly impressive. Its workdays-lost rate (related to accidents) in the United States is 69 times better than the average for all U.S. industry and 17 times better than the average for the U.S. chemicals industry. Even the worldwide rate for Du Pont&rsquo;s 146 facilities is 67 times better than the U.S. average. In the wake of the recent disaster in Bhopal, India, where 2,500 people died and more than 100,000 were injured due to leakage of gas from a chemicals plant, Du Pont&rsquo;s performance takes on far greater significance. During the past five years, Du Pont&rsquo;s 157,000 employees have been involved in only 253 lost-workday injuries. If the company had been typical of U.S. industry, it would have had more than 12,000 such injuries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How does Du Pont do it? It begins by converting the corporate </span><span class="c2">value</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of safety into an explicit </span><span class="c2">objective</span><span class="c3">&mdash;zero accidents. This objective is based on the </span><span class="c2">belief</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that all accidents are preventable. One Du Pont plant with 2,000 workers actually went for 445 days without a recordable injury. At Du Pont safety is a line management responsibility. All managers, from the chairman of the board to the supervisors who manage groups of workers in plants or offices around the world, are responsible for safety in their departments. If an injury occurs in any Du Pont plant, it is reported to world headquarters within 24 hours. If a death occurs, it is reported to the chairman. At Du Pont the CEO is also the chief safety officer, and at all executive committee meetings, safety is first on the agenda.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same importance is given to safety by plant managers. Every plant defines standards, sets goals, designs a safety program, and conducts regular safety audits. Training is a key element. The first thing taught in every training program is safety. Studies have shown that safety performance is proportionate to the level of training of the work-force, so training is continued as an ongoing activity. More impressive than all these things is the fact that all supervisors in Du Pont facilities must review one safety feature every single day with each of their subordinates. Every sales and administrative department also conducts regular safety meetings. An open file drawer in a Du Pont office is considered a safety hazard and attracts immediate attention.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is also a specific set of safety-related rules. Wearing seat belts in company vehicles while on company business is mandatory. Defensive-driving courses are given to employees who travel on the job by car. When one traveling employee in Florida was identified by his manager as a problem driver, an outside driving expert was flown down from Wilmington the next day to give him special instruction.</span></p><a id="id.pzaomb8gw53t"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Safety is the responsibility of every employee at Du Pont, not just managers. Rules are enforced by discipline, and violations are a serious matter. Leon C. Schaller, section manager in the employee relations department, says, &quot;Anyone working for Du Pont knows the fastest and surest route to getting fired is to repeatedly violate safety rules and procedures.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The company tries to positively involve workers in the safety program.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Safety at Du Pont does not end at 5 P.M. There are off-the-job safety programs, too. According to the National Safety Council, in 1983 off-the-job accidents cost the nation $25 billion, of which $8.5 billion was borne by employers. Although it is still many times safer to work at Du Pont than to play off the job, the company has managed to reduce off-the-job accidents by 58 percent over the last 30 years. Through special programs at some locations, the percentage of Du Pont employees wearing seat belts during nonwork hours has been raised to 70 percent, compared with a 20 percent national average. In fact, as you drive out of a Du Pont parking lot, the guard could ask you to buckle up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Does Du Pont&rsquo;s obsession with safety really justify the cost? According to John Page, director of safety and occupational health, &quot;Safety is good business.&quot; The average cost of a disabling injury in the United States works out to about $17,000. On that basis, Du Pont would have spent an additional $48 million last year if its safety record were at the all-industry rate. The company&rsquo;s workers&rsquo; compensation costs measured in dollars per employee are about one-tenth the all-industry level. That translates into annual savings of about $30 million.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Safety pays in other ways, too. Page says:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">It is an outstanding human relations tool. What better way is there to show concern for people than to show concern for their safety and health? It pays in the protection of the skills that they have built up and in the elimination of suffering. It pays in the reduction of workers&rsquo; compensation and maintenance rates and in the loss of property. Show me a manager who cannot protect his people from hurting themselves, and I&rsquo;ll show you a manager who is not a good manager in anything he does. Show me a manager who manages safety well, and I&rsquo;ll show you a manager who manages quality well, production well, costs well, too. The technique that you learn in managing safety applies to any parameter. There is a tremendous payback, and the biggest payback is in the efficiency of management.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have said that corporate intensity is generated by perfect attention to small details. We asked Page what is the smallest detail that is considered important for safety at Du Pont. &quot;A toothpick or paper clip on the floor is a safety hazard,&quot; he replied. At Du Pont value implementation has been taken another step further down the line. It includes conversion of the value into a policy and the policy into an objective for each facility, commitment and active responsibility by top management, establishment of standards and rules, ongoing training, systems for monitoring and enforcement, middle-and lower-level management responsibility, regular meetings, and involvement of all personnel on a daily basis.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This is an excellent example of comprehensive value implementation. Not only is implementation done through formal systems and procedures but the value has become so fully institutionalized that it is a custom or culture of the company. As a value becomes more institutionalized, the formal structures for implementation fade out of use.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">An Idea Becomes an Attitude</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In December 1975 a 32-year-old stockbroker, a married man with children, failed to pay the quarterly premium on his $100,000 life insurance policy with Northwestern Mutual. In spite of repeated reminders from the company, the policy owner allowed his policy to lapse. Six months later the man&rsquo;s wife phoned the Northwestern Mutual agent who had sold the policy to her husband and informed the agent that her husband had been hospitalized with a brain tumor. The doctors said he had only one or two years to live. She was informed by the agent that the policy had lapsed. The agent was quite upset and started dwelling on the case in his mind. He recalled a casual statement of the man&rsquo;s wife that her husband had been making irrational business decisions for several months, perhaps because of the tumor. The agent referred the matter to the Northwestern Mutual head office, asking if anything could be done. The company agreed to reopen the case for investigation. Months went by, then one day the policy owner&rsquo;s wife received a call from the agent. The company had decided that her husband had been disabled by his illness prior to the lapse of the policy and was entitled to a waiver of premiums from that time. The policy was reinstated at no cost. On hearing the news the woman replied, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Why does a company behave in this manner? The simplest answer is because its mission says it should, but that reply only begs the question. Why should a company have a mission that states, &quot;The aim is to be first in benefits to policyholders rather than first in size&quot;? Partly the mission reflects the fact that Northwestern is a mutual company, which means that its policyholders share in its earnings and elect its trustees. Serving the policy owners is equivalent to serving the shareholders. But this is also true of at least a dozen of the largest American life insurers founded after 1842, which differ significantly in the way they conduct their business. As John Gurda wrote in </span><span class="c9 c11">The Quiet Company</span><a id="id.z2s5c1595qie"></a><span class="c9">: &quot;Mutual companies &hellip; assume lives of their own. They vary widely in personality. &hellip; &quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><a id="id.x7e2t568gzkn"></a><span class="c9">&nbsp;Partly it is because the company was founded in Wisconsin and situated in Milwaukee, a city dominated by European immigrants, mostly of German extraction, and known for its ethic of hard work. Northwestern Mutual was the only one of the ten largest life insurance companies born west of Philadelphia. Gurda observed, &quot;The roots of its character go deep into the substance of Milwaukee. &hellip; Both the company and the city are frugal, slow to change, somewhat complacent, somewhat parochial. Quality is more important to both than size.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;One other important factor in molding the company&rsquo;s personality was the financial difficulty that beset it during its early years. The Wisconsin economy was primarily agricultural, whereas life insurance companies had hitherto prospered in industrial areas with surplus capital. When John C. Johnston, the founder, died in 1860, the company took four years to pay off his claim. Financial pressures made it essential for the company to minimize claims by issuing policies only to very good risks. While other companies were relaxing their standards for underwriting new policies, Northwestern Mutual was tightening its own.</span></p><a id="id.67pt0t7ne29e"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">These were the dominant factors influencing the company at the time when Henry Palmer was elected president in 1874 and drafted the company&rsquo;s credo. Palmer, who had been a judge prior to joining the company, was a conservative man even by Milwaukee standards. He established four basic principles that still govern Northwestern Mutual today&mdash;simple products, low expenses, high risk standards, and cautious investments. &quot;When Palmer arrived, Northwestern had a personality. When he left, it had a character, and that character has endured to the present.&quot; </span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup></p><a id="id.rvq53uh1o5f6"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">During Palmer&rsquo;s term of office, which covered 3&frac12; decades, the company&rsquo;s agency field force developed a high reputation for professional skill and an intense loyalty to the company. Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s agents became noted for high ethical standards and an almost religious zeal for serving the customer, which prompted one president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to comment: &quot;You can tell an Equitable agent by his checkered vest, a Prudential agent by his kit, and a Northwestern Mutual agent by his halo.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;When the life insurance industry was subjected to close scrutiny by a Senate committee during Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s presidency, many of the large eastern companies were indicted for a variety of abuses ranging from bribery to illegal investments. About the worst accusation against Northwestern Mutual was that its management was self-perpetuating, which was certainly true during Palmer&rsquo;s 35-year reign.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All these factors help to explain the character and conduct of the company, but there is one more that stands out from the rest&mdash;the credo itself. Being better in order to be bigger may be considered a sensible idea by which to run a business, but being better instead of being bigger is not a business idea at all. It transcends business. It is an ethical ideal. Taken as a mission for corporate behavior, it is a goal that challenges management and every one of the employees in every activity they undertake in each and every minute of every day&mdash;in dealing with each other, in dealing with the company&rsquo;s agents, and in dealing with the policy owners&mdash;to strive for qualitative excellence rather than quantitative gain. The acceptance of such a goal, however imperfectly it may be carried out in practice, imposes an ultimate discipline on the company that no system of authority can match. It demands a constant effort to think always of what is best for the customer and to act according to that knowledge.</span></p><a id="id.prp1rb46x88y"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Two incidents illustrate the practical impact of this idea. During the late 1970s, rising interest and inflation rates and intense competition within the life insurance industry prompted most companies, including Northwestern Mutual, to offer significantly better protection to new policy owners than had been offered in the past. Alone among the major insurers, Northwestern Mutual felt obligated by its code of fairness to offer the same terms retroactively to all its existing policy owners through a massive, costly, and time-consuming program called Update &rsquo;80. In a period of sagging business for the industry, the program helped Northwestern Mutual achieve its best year on record and to reap a rich harvest of goodwill from its policy owners. As Gurda wrote, &quot;Update &rsquo;80 made Northwestern a highly visible champion of mutuality and fairness.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During 1983 the company conducted a similar amendment program that offered the owners of policies issued before January 1, 1982 an opportunity to receive higher dividends on the unborrowed cash values of their policies. This dividend feature is a part of all Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s permanent insurance policies issued after January 1, 1982.</span></p><a id="id.pus2bqhzr4nv"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Another test of Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s operating principle arose when the prime rate touched 20 percent in 1980 and policy owners rushed to apply for loans on their policies at the stipulated 5 percent interest rate. The demand for policy loans, surrender payments, and commissions rose so high that the company&rsquo;s cash outflow on loans and commissions virtually equaled the $800 million in premiums received during the year.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;In 1981 loans rose to more than 30 percent of assets. Many insurance companies employed a variety of techniques to delay the issuing of policy loans as long as possible. There is a clause in Northwestern Mutual&rsquo;s policies that permits the firm to take up to six months to issue policy loans. However, in practice the company adopted a policy of processing loan applications on a top-priority basis within three days from receipt. It also allowed a practice by which a loan of up to $1,000 could be obtained without any delay directly from the company&rsquo;s local agencies upon presentation of the policy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What type of person did Northwestern Mutual grow up to be? Our impression is of a company quiet and reliable&mdash;everyone spoke very softly, yet seemed unaware that they were doing so and denied it was according to any policy&mdash;consistent and conservative, yet very hard-working and surprisingly dynamic, honest and fair, friendly and cheerful, proud and responsible, accomplished yet ambitious, &quot;with an almost religious devotion to excellence.&quot; There is a harmony at Northwestern Mutual between the company&rsquo;s employees, its field agents, and its policy owners&mdash;the harmony of a close-knit family that believes that what it is doing is good. Like any real family, North-western Mutual&rsquo;s family of policy owners is difficult to enter; but once you are inside, the commitment is total.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most impressive thing about Northwestern Mutual is the way it translates its highest ideals into daily practice. We have already looked at companies that implement values through a strictly enforced policy, rigorous training, carefully monitored systems, and detailed operating procedures. Northwestern Mutual has all of these things, and it uses them to express several of its core values like cost control, speed and skill of service, and cooperation between office and field staff. But when it comes to the company&rsquo;s single most important value, which is the basis of its mission, the primary means for its implementation is none of these. Rather, it is expressed through the personal attitudes of the employees and the agents. Service at Northwestern Mutual is not&mdash;at least it is no longer&mdash;merely a policy or program established by top management and implemented through the company&rsquo;s operating systems. It is an attitude that saturates the entire personality and atmosphere of the company and has become institutionalized as a self-perpetuating custom or culture of the organization. That attitude influences the way all employees in the company think about their work and act in executing it, without anyone else&rsquo;s reminding them or instructing them to do it. It is not even the force of peer pressure that perpetuates it. It is a pressure from within each person, not from outside. Northwestern Mutual is the most mature example of value implementation that we have come across, a place where the value is actually internalized by the employees as a personal belief and commitment in their own lives. As Jere Whiteley, assistant regional director of agencies, put it: &quot;I think the company would run without anyone sitting at the top, because everyone has their job, and I think it would run just as well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Ever Present Challenge</span></p><a id="id.91cujw88nqnt"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The three questions we raised in the beginning of this chapter are directly relevant to every company in every field of business, regardless of its age. First, why do companies adopt idealistic values? &quot;The goals of a business give the people who work in it the direction they need to increase their vigor and their strength,&quot; wrote Kappel of AT&amp;T. &quot;Goals that excite people&rsquo;s imagination, and rouse them to strive toward accomplishment presently out of reach, are a powerful energizing force.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;When we speak of a goal, we usually mean a particular destination to be reached in a specific period of time&mdash;that is, an objective. But values like honesty, safety, service are also goals. They are permanent goals that can never be fully attained or maintained but serve as a standard of perfection to strive for at every moment in every activity. For this reason they appear more vague than specific objectives but are actually far more powerful. The constant effort of an organization to realize high values in action is a powerful lever for releasing latent energies and converting them into intensity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In chapter 1 we looked at several different ways in which intensity is generated in a company&mdash;in reaction to a crisis, in response to an opportunity, or by a self-imposed challenge to achieve a higher goal. The highest levels of corporate intensity are achieved when a company accepts the greatest challenge of them all&mdash;the pursuit of an ideal, the striving toward a high value, the quest for excellence. The goal may vary from company to company. It may be an ideal like service to society, as at AT&amp;T. It may be a value such as the welfare and well-being of employees, as at Delta. It may be excellence in quality, as at Coca-Cola, or in customer service, as at Marriott. Whatever the goal, the higher it is and the more seriously it is pursued and the more thoroughly it influences the day-to-day activities of the company, the greater is the intensity it generates. A genuine commitment to a higher goal is akin to constantly holding a set of barbells over one&rsquo;s head. It requires an ongoing, unwavering effort. It demands a tremendous expenditure of energy. It generates a steady, ever present upward tension. Yet with each step forward, the personality grows stronger. Greater energies flow in and are put to work. Corporate intensity is the result.</span></p><a id="id.3fcnxi7b7l5n"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">All of the companies we referred to emphatically insist that pursuit of higher values is a key to their success. Public confidence in Johnson &amp; Johnson made possible the dramatic recovery of Tylenol. As Chairman James Burke put it, &quot;We learned that the reputation of the corporation &hellip; provided a reservoir of goodwill among the public, the people in the regulatory agencies, and the media, which was of incalculable value in helping to restore the brand.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span class="c3">Sears&rsquo; policy of providing reliable products backed by an ironclad guarantee won the trust of American farmers, many of whom later migrated to the cities and formed a loyal core of customers for the company&rsquo;s retail store business. Merck&rsquo;s insistence on factual, objective product presentations and fair balance has earned it the respect of the medical community and the No. 1 position in the industry. Du Pont&rsquo;s obsession with safety for two centuries has saved the company hundreds of millions of dollars, won the loyalty of its employees, and earned it the best reputation in the chemicals industry. And Northwestern Mutual? Well, the point does not require repetition; it is first in everything (except, of course, size).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">In support of this, we can cite a little informal research relating to one particular corporate value&mdash;public service. The research was carried out by Johnson &amp; Johnson in collaboration with The Business Roundtable&rsquo;s Task Force on Corporate Responsibility and The Ethics Resource Center in Washington, D.C. A list was compiled of those major corporations that had &quot;a codified set of principles stating the philosophy that serving the public was central to their being&quot; and for which there was solid evidence that these ideas had been promulgated and practiced for at least a generation by their organizations. The performance of these companies over the last three decades was then examined. The findings were impressive. On an average, these companies had an annual compound growth rate in profits of 11 percent, which works out to a 23-fold increase in profits over 30 years. This is compared to only a 2.5-fold increase in GNP during the same period and only a 5.3-fold increase in profits for all </span><span class="c9 c11">Fortune</span><a id="id.v75p3ltwyqtu"></a><span class="c9">&nbsp;500 companies.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Most Important Person</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Who determines the guiding values of a company? At the heart of the corporate personality is a deeper psychic center, consisting of the company&rsquo;s most cherished beliefs, values, and true mission, which give lifelong direction to the activities of the corporation. As in the development of personality in the individual, the process by which the corporate personality acquires a specific set of beliefs and values is influenced by several factors&mdash;the personality of its founders, external social conditions at the time of its birth, and geography, as well as experiences and important persons that enter its life later on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When a company is born, it acquires from its founder or founders many of their dominant beliefs, values, attitudes, opinions, and objectives in life, in much the same way as a child inherits its early value system from its parents. Marriott Corporation inherited a tradition of hard work and an insistence on quality from Bill, Sr. Delta inherited the thrifty ways and personal kindness of C. E. Woolman. External factors also influence the values a company acquires. Like many middle-aged people today, both Delta and Marriott Corporation were children of the Great Depression. Geography had a significant impact on all the companies we visited&mdash;California informality at Apple and Intel, midwestern hard work at Northwestern Mutual, and southern gentility at Coca-Cola. In addition, the experiences of the company during its formative and later years are influential. Deregulation has profoundly affected the values and objectives of commercial airlines in the United States. Divestiture has imposed new priorities and new demands on AT&amp;T. The succession of CEOs that come after the founder leave a mark on the corporate personality as well, in proportion to the strength of their own character and the length of their stay at the helm of affairs. Rosenwald and Wood at Sears, Woodruff at Coca-Cola, and Palmer at Northwestern Mutual were far more influential than the companies&rsquo; founders in shaping corporate values.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a result of all these influences, the company acquires a core of central beliefs, values, attitudes, a mission, and objectives&mdash;the psychic center of the corporate personality&mdash;that gives direction to all the firm&rsquo;s activities. The ideas that constitute the psychic center are of several types, and the words used to designate them are frequently interchanged or used as synonyms; therefore, it is better to briefly define the most important of them here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Beliefs</span><span class="c3">: Beliefs are ideas or principles that are accepted by an individual or an institution as true and serve as a basis for its actions. Johnson &amp; Johnson believes that service to the public helps a business to prosper. Merck believes that &quot;good ethics makes good sense.&quot; IBM believes that &quot;if we respect our people and help them to respect themselves, the company will make the most profit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Values</span><span class="c3">. Values are the operational qualities that companies seek to achieve or maintain in their performance. We do not use the word in a strictly moral sense, although ethical values may be included. There are many functional corporate values. Here are some of the most important physical, organizational, and psychological values:</span></p><table class="c43"><tr class="c32"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Physical</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Organizational</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Psychological</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Cleanliness</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Discipline</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Respect for the individual</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Orderliness</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Freedom</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Pleasing the customer</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Punctuality, regularity</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Motivation</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Harmony(family feeling)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Efficient use of money and materials</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Standardization</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Decisiveness</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Maintenance of equipment</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Systemization</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Integrity</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Quality of product, service, or work</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Coordination</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Loyalty, trust</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Maximum utilization of time</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Integration</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Commitment</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Optimum utilization of space</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Communication</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Personal growth</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c53"><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Safety</span></p></td><td class="c63" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Cooperation (teamwork)</span></p></td><td class="c33" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Service to society</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Mission</span><span class="c3">. A mission is the guiding purpose for which an organization exists. The mission is not a statement of beliefs or values, but rather a statement of broad intention. General Motors Corporation&rsquo;s mission, as formulated by its founder, William Durant, was to produce &quot;a car for every purse and purpose.&quot; Ford Motor Company&rsquo;s original mission was to build an inexpensive car for the masses. AT&amp;T&rsquo;s was to provide service to all telephone users throughout the United States under a standardized policy and a single, unified system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Objectives</span><span class="c3">. Objectives are the specific goals that a company seeks to fulfill in carrying out its mission in accordance with the beliefs and values it has accepted. Objectives range from broad and general to narrow and specific. IBM has a broad objective &quot;to serve our customers as efficiently and as effectively as we can.&quot; General Mills has a specific objective to achieve a 20 percent return on equity every year. Coca-Cola&rsquo;s present objectives include doubling its revenues between 1984 and 1990.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Corporate attitudes</span><span class="c3">. Corporate beliefs and values are the ideas that guide the decisions of top management, the choice of its mission and objectives, the formulation of its policies and plans. In addition to these central beliefs and values, an organization, like an individual, possesses a variety of fixed attitudes relating to particular issues. When the psychic center is well developed, these attitudes tend to be in harmony with the central beliefs and values of the organization. The helpful attitude of the Northwestern Mutual agent reflects a mature psychic center. The company&rsquo;s mission to serve the policy owners has become a personal attitude of the agent. On the other hand, in companies where the psychic center is not yet developed&mdash;where beliefs, values, and mission are poorly defined or poorly translated into action&mdash;the common corporate attitudes expressed at lower levels of the organization tend to be at variance with or in opposition to the company&rsquo;s stated convictions. We all know countless instances of companies that proclaim good customer service as a top priority but where the attitudes of customer-service personnel do not seem to reflect that stated goal.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Psychic Center</span></p><a id="id.ub7tkblotbno"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c9">In mature corporations the psychic center becomes organized around a few fundamental beliefs and core values that determine its mission, fix its long-term goals and short-term objectives, and influence a wide range of attitudes expressed at different levels of the company.

We return now to the third question. How, then, does the psychic center interact with the rest of the corporate personality and impose its direction on the company&rsquo;s activities? How does it implement its ideas?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The psychic center provides two types of guidance to the organization. It establishes the basic character and orientation, and it determines its particular initiatives and actions. We can liken these two functions to those of the autonomic and voluntary nervous systems in the human being. The autonomic nervous system controls the functioning of the organs and systems that support and maintain life without the need of any conscious awareness or volition by the individual. This life-supporting role is akin to that of the psychic center&rsquo;s beliefs, values, and attitudes. They underlie and influence all the activities of the corporation but usually function unnoticed and unthought of. The voluntary nervous system in the individual controls conscious initiatives and the movements of the muscles that govern outward behavior and actions. The parallel function in the company is the formulation and execution of work according to the priorities set by the company during the planning process, based on its mission and objectives. Thus, there are two distinct but interacting pathways for translating ideas into action:</span></p><table class="c69"><tr class="c32"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Value Implementation</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Plan Implementation</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">(Autonomic system)</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">(Voluntary system)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Beliefs and values</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Mission</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Structure</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Objectives</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Standards and regulations</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Plans</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Systems</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Policies</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Skills</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Strategies</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Attitudes</span></p></td><td class="c47" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Programs</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process of plan implementation is well known, but the process of value implementation has received relatively little attention and requires further elaboration.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Process of Value Implementation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">In the entrepreneurial stage of a company&rsquo;s growth, the founder or CEO makes a </span><span class="c9 c11">decision</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;about which values are most important and ensures that they are implemented by his or her own personal effort and attention. Bill Marriott, Sr., insisted on quality in his first seven Hot Shoppes by personally visiting each facility every day to inspect the operations. At a later stage of growth, the organization institutionalizes the attention to values by the creation of separate departments to assume responsibility for each of the most important values. A controller&rsquo;s office is established to enforce the values of thrift and efficiency. A research division is created to foster the value of innovation. A human resources department is set up to give proper attention to employees. A customer service desk is opened; perhaps even a safety department, as at Du Pont; and so on. Each value has been institutionalized as a </span><span class="c9 c11">structure</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">At the next level, performance </span><span class="c9 c11">standards</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;are set with respect to each value, </span><span class="c9 c11">rules</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;are established, and </span><span class="c9 c11">systems</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;are designed to enforce the rules and achieve the standards. At first, there are many separate systems operating somewhat independently of each other&mdash;some for quality control, some for cost control, some for innovation, some for customer service, and so forth. Gradually the systems become more and more </span><span class="c9 c11">coordinated</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;with each other to eliminate duplicate and conflicting activities and improve efficiency. Later, systems at different levels of the organization are </span><span class="c9 c11">integrated</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with one another to function in a harmonious manner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Achieving values requires a variety of specialized </span><span class="c9 c11">skills</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;for their effective expression. Product innovation and quality control require technical skills. Customer service and good communication with employees require interpersonal skills. Coordination and integration require organizational skills. Discipline and motivation require managerial skills. Companies </span><span class="c9 c11">recruit</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;people with the essential personality traits and </span><span class="c9 c11">train</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;them to impart the skills needed to achieve the values they consider most important. Merck recruits professional representatives &quot;with a good impact, a high energy level, and an elevator that goes all the way to the top&quot; and then trains them in the necessary skills for presenting drugs to doctors. In hiring customer-service representatives, Hertz Corporation looks for people with energy and a sensitivity toward people and then teaches them how to handle customers pleasantly, even when a customer may be angry or upset for some reason.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The highest level of organized value implementation is achieved through an appropriate structure, standards and rules, systems that are coordinated and integrated, and people recruited and trained to possess the right skills and traits. But it is possible to raise the quality of value implementation to an even higher level by creating an institutional milieu or culture. This usually occurs naturally, after a formal system as described above has been in operation for many years. The values gradually become so deeply ingrained in the people and the organization that external systems of enforcement are no longer necessary. An atmosphere of peer pressure develops that acts to uphold the value and discourage deviation. At Merck we were told that if a copywriter of promotional material ever got a little too exuberant in praising the virtues of a drug, peer pressure would immediately force him or her to retract the idea. In many mature companies the most important values have become part of the </span><span class="c9 c11">institutional milieu</span><span class="c3">. The Hewlett-Packard Company was able to do away with time clocks and removed the locks on the laboratory storerooms because an atmosphere of peer pressure &quot;enforces&quot; responsible behavior from employees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">At a still more advanced stage, the individuals in the company come to accept the importance of living up to the company&rsquo;s values, even in the absence of external pressure from peers. They feel that it is part of doing the job right. Hard work at Marriott, satisfying the customer at Sears, safety at Du Pont have become </span><span class="c9 c11">customs</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;in these organizations. Finally a stage is reached when the individuals in the company internalize the value and make it a personal conviction in their own lives. They come to feel, like the Delta flight attendants, that making the customer happy is not just a part of the job but is also a means to their own happiness. Many Northwestern Mutual agents come to believe that benefiting the policy owner is a way to make their own life richer and more rewarding&mdash;which prompted one business journal to describe Northwestern Mutual as &quot;the company created by God, or so its agents would have you think.&quot; When a company has many employees who have adopted its central values as their own personal values, then we can truly speak of a mature </span><span class="c9 c11">culture</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;within the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ten Steps for Implementing Values</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are ten steps a company can take to implement values:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">1.</span><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;Decision</span><span class="c3">: Choose a value that you are fully willing to implement and then make a total commitment to live by it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">2.</span><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;Structure</span><span class="c3">: Create a suitable structure for implementing the value, with a clear allocation of responsibility and clear lines of authority.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">3.</span><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;Standards</span><span class="c3">: Precisely define the standards you seek to attain and maintain with reference to the value.

Intensity is the direct result of a company&rsquo;s commitment to a higher belief or higher value to an extent far beyond the level achieved by ordinary companies. What is the role of the CEO in this process? The decision to adopt a higher belief or value requires a tremendous mental effort on the part of a CEO. The very thought of maintaining a commitment to full employment during the 1930s when markets were crumbling would have been enough to send most executives into a permanent &quot;depression.&quot; Tom Watson, Sr., not only thought about it but actually decided to do it as an expression of commitment to one of IBM&rsquo;s cardinal beliefs. You can be sure that decision was hard work!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But this was only the beginning. Once such a decision has been made, it must travel a very long, ever widening path to be fully put into practice by the company. This path consists of simultaneous movements in two directions. On the one hand, the decision of the CEO or the board of directors must be communicated to all the other levels of the organization and accepted by them with the right attitude and commensurate enthusiasm. On the other hand, the decision must be translated into corporate policy; converted into programs for execution by top-, middle-, and lower-level management; and reduced to action plans for implementation on the plant floor or in the field.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Watson&rsquo;s work did not end with his decision. He had to carry conviction with the board of directors and top executives and, through them, with all the levels below. It was not only acceptance of his decision that was required but a wholehearted commitment at all levels to carrying it out. In practice, this meant that IBM would have to multiply its sales effort during the depression in order to maintain production volume. It also meant that every possible effort had to be made to improve productivity and reduce operating costs in order to compensate for the possibility of falling revenues that could not be offset by reducing labor costs, since full employment was to be maintained. When other companies in the 1930s were feeling that labor was a dispensable and disposable resource, IBM introduced programs to improve its workers&rsquo; skills and output.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Watson had to inspire confidence throughout the entire organization. He had to enthuse managers and workers for a far greater effort, and he had to conceive of programs for translating his belief into action without endangering the corporation&rsquo;s very existence. These two movements&mdash;communication of the decision throughout the organization with an enthusiasm for implementing it and translation of the decision at the top into programs at the bottom&mdash;require an enormous expenditure of energy, a total effort, and a constant strain to keep up their momentum.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In order to fully accomplish these movements throughout the entire corporation, the chief executive must continuously increase the quantity of his or her effort. At the same time, the quality of the CEO&rsquo;s energy must change. Mental energy, which has converted the ideal into a policy, must be augmented by buoyant vital energy to communicate the right attitude to others and release their enthusiasm, and these must be supported by physical energy for translation of the policy into action. The entire energy of the leader&rsquo;s personality must pour forth and sustain the movement until the whole company endorses the idea, is enthused with the right attitude, and implements the program. The energy that is expressed as thoughts, will, emotions, enthusiasm, commitment, determination, and eagerness builds up into a pure energy of personality and turns into a simple intensity that radiates from his or her being.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same process of release, accumulation, and conversion takes place at all levels of the organization as the movement spreads vertically and horizontally. It is communicated from one level to the next, from one department to the next, and one person to the next, until the whole company is saturated with mental, nervous, and physical energy that accumulates as a pure energy of the corporate personality and radiates as corporate intensity throughout the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In IBM&rsquo;s case, the impact of Watson&rsquo;s decision cannot be overstated. As one IBM executive explained it:</span></p><a id="id.br8xivpoom2f"></a><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c9">It is not correct to say that we managed to maintain employment during the depression because we grew. We grew because we had committed ourselves to the maintenance of employment. This forced us to find new users and uses for our existing products. It forced us to find unsatisfied wants in the market and to develop new products to satisfy them. It forced us to develop foreign markets and to push export sales. I am convinced that we would not today be one of the world&rsquo;s leading producers and exporters of office machinery but for our commitment to maintain employment during the depression years. Indeed, I sometimes wonder whether we wouldn&rsquo;t be well advised to commit ourselves to increasing employment constantly.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">That is the power of translating a higher value into action.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Luxury for the Rich</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.w483ke1vtmus"><span class="c9">Serving the public, maintaining a good corporate reputation, formulating a high-sounding credo and idealistic mission statement may be fine for AT&amp;T, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Northwestern Mutual, and Sears, but what about the little outfit? Aren&rsquo;t high values really a luxury that only rich, successful companies can afford? The answer is that all these companies adopted high values when they </span><span class="c9 c11">were</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;little outfits, and it is these values that enabled them to grow to their present stature. When Tom Watson insisted on the value of job security for employees during the Great Depression, IBM&rsquo;s annual revenues were less than $20 million. Today they are 2,000 times greater. When Rosenwald introduced the money-back guarantee at Sears, the company had only $750,000 in sales. Last year Sears&rsquo; sales were 44,000 times higher. When C. E. Woolman began treating his employees like members of the family, Delta&rsquo;s entire fleet consisted of 12 airplanes with a total value of about $25,000. Today its property and equipment are valued at 100,000 times that amount. Striving for high values is not a luxury for the rich; it is a way to become rich.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 4 - The Living Organization</span></h1><p class="c39"><span class="c3">Take away everything else but leave me my organization and in ten years I&rsquo;ll be back on top.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">&mdash;Andrew Carnegie</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are two common misconceptions about the dramatic recovery of Chrysler in the early 1980s. First, the magnitude of Lee Iacocca&rsquo;s achievement has been grossly underestimated. Those who refer to the record $3.3 billion in profits that Chrysler earned between 1982 and 1984 are 50 percent short of the mark. In actual fact, Chrysler earned $6.6 billion during this period. This error arises because people forget that during the years 1979 to 1981, the company was generating a record $3 million a day (in losses, that is)&mdash;a total of $3.3 billion over three years. Iacocca not only overcame a $3.3 billion deficit but capped it with another $3.3 billion profit between 1982 and 1984. That represents a net gain of $6.6 billion, or an average increase in earnings of $6 million per day over the previous period.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coming to the second misconception, there is an important unsung hero in the Chrysler story. While no one can overstate Iacocca&rsquo;s remarkable achievement, there is another person at least equally de-serving of our attention. In 1979 the financial experts were unanimous in their diagnosis that Chrysler was all but dead. Has anyone ever actually explained how they could have been so wrong? What the experts failed to perceive was the huge reservoir of vitality trapped within the organization and waiting for an opportunity to pour forth. One of Iacocca&rsquo;s greatest acts was to peel away the encrusting layers of dead habits, vested interests, outmoded strategies, and inertia and remove the lid on an enormous reservoir of productive energies. He did it by firing 33 of the company&rsquo;s 35 vice-presidents and allowing long-suppressed ideas, energies, and talents to rise to the surface.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Where did all that vitality come from? It came from within the organization itself. It had been there all the time as an untapped potential. In the process of housecleaning and reorganization, Iacocca stumbled upon an unsung hero&mdash;the enormous hidden powers of organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Accounts of great human inventions usually begin with the pot or the wheel and work their way up to the transistor and the silicon chip. Most of them omit one of the greatest discoveries of all time&mdash;organization. A discovery usually brings into use hidden potentials that were previously unknown, or it creates new possibilities that were hitherto unimagined. Organization does both. Organization makes possible the productive and efficient utilization of ideas, resources, energies, and opportunities.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Great Discovery</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The organization was discovered when a leader first had the idea that far more could be accomplished if he or she could collect a group of people and have them execute work according to the leader&rsquo;s designs and instructions. This was humanity&rsquo;s first glimpse of the power of organization. In 1931 a young businessman was on the verge of making this discovery for himself. In the previous four years, he had built up a chain of five drive-in restaurants in the Washington, D.C., area and was just making plans to open a sixth. He approached a top business lawyer to close the deal on a property for the new restaurant. The lawyer hesitated. He had seen too many restaurant owners do exactly what the young entrepreneur was doing and end up bankrupt. &quot;My advice to you, young man, is to get out of this restaurant business. Quick,&quot; the lawyer said. &quot;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of clients in this business, and they&rsquo;re all going broke &hellip; Your trouble is, you want to expand &hellip; But you&rsquo;ll never get anywhere by expanding, because then you can&rsquo;t control it. You can&rsquo;t control the root beer in eight or ten different shops at the same time. You can&rsquo;t control all these people who make your sandwiches and be sure that they&rsquo;re all up to your standards. The bigger you get, the less control you have.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Had the young man accepted his lawyer&rsquo;s advice, the story would have ended there; but J. Willard Marriott did not. His story was only just beginning. Marriott believed what the lawyer said about control, but he felt there must be a solution. Until then the company had consisted of several restaurants run by crews under Marriott&rsquo;s direct supervision. The only real link between his five Hot Shoppes was Bill Marriott himself. In other words, there was no real organization. If he was going to expand further, he could not continue to visit every location every day and personally supervise all important operations. He realized that what he needed was a unifying structure to accomplish two things that up until then had been done by his direct personal supervision and management: It must maintain the quality of the product and service, and it must also encourage and motivate employees at each restaurant as he had done in the past by his friendly personal attention.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Marriott accomplished the first objective by centralization and specialization. He established a carefully supervised central commissary to purchase food and other materials in bulk, process and portion raw food into individual servings, and prepare certain standard items like soup and coleslaw for distribution to all the shops. He then hired a professional food consultant to develop tested and standardized recipes for each dish on the Hot Shoppes menu, and he printed detailed cooking instructions in a small book so that dishes could be prepared in exactly the same way each time they were cooked, regardless of which shop they were prepared in. He also developed systems to reduce the work of each shop to a set of standard operating procedures, which covered every aspect of the shops&rsquo; functioning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">To accomplish the second objective, motivating restaurant staff, Marriott introduced a policy of promotion from within and performance-based bonuses, and he lavished attention on his employees. He learned to delegate authority and decision-making responsibility at the restaurants to experienced managers who had started as busboys and worked their way up in the shops. He followed the practice of never opening a new shop until he had an experienced person to run it. He recruited his employees carefully&mdash;only &quot;good, clean-cut, decent people&quot; who were willing to work hard&mdash;treated them in a friendly and fair manner, won their loyalty, and then entrusted the work to them. Shop managers and staff were paid annual bonuses based on the profitability of their shops.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1937 a crew member from an Eastern Air Transport flight stopped at Hot Shoppe No. 8 for a quart of coffee to take on the flight to New York. Soon passengers started to come by before their flights to purchase sandwiches and drinks. Before long the Hot Shoppe was supplying box lunches to the airline for service during its flights, and within a year it was servicing all 22 daily flights from the Washington airport. The in-flight catering business had been born utilizing the same structure and systems developed for service in the restaurants.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There was nothing unique or original about the organization Bill Marriott developed. It combined centralization to ensure quality control and decentralization to encourage entrepreneurship and individual initiative. Yet to Marriott, who had begun as a sole proprietor doing everything for himself, there must have been a little bit of magic in the idea that something as intangible as an organization could produce such tangible results.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1929 Marriott employed 80 people in three Hot Shoppes and had revenues of about $500,000. A year after Bill Marriott met with his lawyer, gross sales approached the $1 million mark. During the next 20 years, Marriott grew to include 45 restaurants, 3,000 employees, and an in-flight catering service for a dozen airlines. Gross sales in 1952 were just under $20 million. Five years later there were 75 locations, 6,000 employees, and revenues of $36 million a year. This 76-fold expansion had all been based on the simple structure and systems introduced for the opening of Hot Shoppe No. 6.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It was not money that made possible Marriott&rsquo;s phenomenal growth. Though Bill Marriott borrowed $1,500 to start the first root beer stand, thereafter for 25 years he very seldom borrowed a dollar more. It was not any new technology that brought this success, either. Marriott identified a need in the market for fast, clean, convenient roadside service and devised an efficient way to meet it. His success was based on the values of hard work, quality control, cost efficiency, and friendly service; but these ideas could not have achieved anything by themselves. They needed a structure and a system to deliver them to the market. That is the power of an organization.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">From Hot Shoppes to Hotels</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By 1957 Marriott had reached the pinnacle of success and was already grooming his eldest son to succeed him. But the organization he created had only just begun to reveal its power. In that year the company acquired its first hotel, in Arlington, Virginia. The rest is history. In the following 27 years, Marriott grew to become the eighth largest U.S.-based hotel chain in the world, with more than 60,000 rooms; the third largest server of food in the United States, with food service management operations, Roy Rogers, Bob&rsquo;s Big Boy, and airport restaurants; and the largest airline caterer in the world, with 37 percent of the U.S. market and 12 percent worldwide.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Something, of course, has changed at Marriott. Bill, Jr., took over from his father and has managed the company through its second phase of expansion. But the basics remain the same. Gary Wilson, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at Marriott, says:&quot;The common thread we see running through the whole business is the origin we had as a small restaurant company and the centralized systems that Mr. Marriott, Sr., put into his first restaurants, which we really developed as we grew into a larger chain. And as we moved into the hotel business, the same type of systems were used. We have a very strong centralized management system.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The organization still serves the same two basic functions&mdash;to control quality and motivate people. Quality is controlled through centralization and systemization. In most hotel chains each hotel is run by a general manager in the style of an independent entrepreneur with little control from above. But at Marriott there are regional multidisciplinary management teams, each of which controls the operations of about ten hotels from a central office. The hotel managers work under the team, which visits each hotel frequently and possesses expert knowledge in all specialized areas of hotel operations&mdash;food and beverage, marketing, controller, engineering, personnel, and so on. This concept of centralization and specialization had its origin in the company&rsquo;s original commissary. The first specialist was a food consultant. Today the company has specialists in almost every relevant field. &quot;Management has expert resources,&quot; explained John Dixon, general manager of the company&rsquo;s flagship hotel in downtown Washington. &quot;It has three people studying everything.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As in the old days, quality is controlled through a set of finely tuned systems and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Cliff Erhlich, senior vice-president for human resources, summed it up well: &quot;We are the biggest SOP company in the universe. SOPs have been our absolute survival during the period of rapid growth.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Marriott has SOPs for literally everything&mdash;even friendliness. For years we have been impressed by the friendly, informative limousine drivers who take you from the airports to Marriott hotels. It is an SOP. When the bellhop explains the buttons on the elevator as he or she escorts you to your room, it&rsquo;s an SOP. When the lifeguard at the hotel pool removes the &quot;Pool Closed&quot; signs in the morning, it is only one of 14 SOPs for opening the pool, which is only one of his or her nine major daily responsibilities. When the lifeguard replies to your question about the nearest movie theater or the best place to dine, that is an SOP, too. One hotel manager who had previously worked for another major hotel group remarked, while gesturing with his hands to show one pile two feet high and another one inch thick, &quot;SOPs here are like a mountain compared with other hotels.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is the same in food service. There are now over 6,000 recipe cards in the Marriott collection, each containing such clearly detailed instructions that senior executives periodically try their hand at preparing dishes in one of the company&rsquo;s kitchens. The card system precisely indicates the quantity of each ingredient and the size of each portion down to the detail of where the parsley is to be placed on the plate. Marriott runs its airline catering kitchens like factories. Every meal must look exactly like the others. Why? On your next flight, catch yourself glancing over to see what is on your neighbor&rsquo;s plate and you will know why.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The company&rsquo;s systems are equally effective in managing costs. Centralized systems and centralized food procurement have enabled Marriott to achieve substantially higher profit margins on food service than its hotel competitors. A very tight system of financial reporting enables management to control costs and to diagnose problems anywhere in the company at an early stage. &quot;We make more money in the hotel business because we&rsquo;re able to squeeze more profit out of the dollars that we get than any other company,&quot; explained Wilson. &quot;We are able to get more on the bottom line because of our centralized systems.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We usually associate tight discipline, systems, and controls with a rigorous military atmosphere. Yet Marriott has also succeeded in maintaining a high level of employee morale, motivation, and job satisfaction. Employees are trained to regard the systems as a way to help them do their jobs better, which is the key to upward mobility in this company, where about a third of all managers were originally recruited as hourly workers. Marriott believes in discipline, but not force. &quot;You cannot order anything from anybody,&quot; says Bill Marriott, Jr. &quot;They&rsquo;ve got to do it because they want to do it. They&rsquo;ve got to do it because they see that it&rsquo;s important. A lot of these people are really entrepreneurs, particularly the waiters and waitresses. They realize that they can make more money for themselves if they follow the procedures. The name of the game is to convince them that it is in their own interests to do that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The key to the high morale and motivation is the personal attention given to employees. Fred Malek, executive vice-president and head of the hotel division, believes: &quot;The major thing is making them feel good about themselves and what they are doing, giving them opportunities for recognition and promotion, by recognizing their good work, by giving them some attention, by not just treating them as workers, but as colleagues, treating them with respect, with dignity, treating them as partners in the enterprise.&quot; This is the way Bill, Sr., related to his staff of 80 when there were only three Hot Shoppes. The same attitude has been passed down to his sons and institutionalized through personal example. When Bill, Jr., visits a Marriott hotel, his most important work is to shake hands with as many employees as possible. He says: &quot;We have to be friendly with our people. Then they&rsquo;ll be friendly with the customers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Marriott employs a highly centralized, specialized, and systematized organizational structure to maintain uniform quality standards, keep costs to a minimum, and provide what many people consider the friendliest service in the industry. It is now extending the same approach to provide lodging and food, recreational facilities, and health care to senior citizens at its life-care communities. Marriott&rsquo;s revenues in 1984 reached $3.4 billion, nearly 175 times the 1952 level, and the company&rsquo;s goal is to triple its size over the next six years in order to reach $10 billion by the end of the decade. Fred Malek makes it sound easy. &quot;Everybody can do it. It just takes a will and a systematic effort.&quot; That is the power of an organization.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Power of Organization</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is a power generated by the proper combination of unrelated things. When salt, glucose, and water are mixed together in the right proportions, they constitute a very simple but highly effective cure for the dehydration caused by diarrhea. Hailed as &quot;potentially the most important medical advance in this century,&quot; oral rehydration offers an inexpensive, readily available remedy for an ailment that kills some 5 million to 8 million children every year in developing countries. Since this formula was popularized in India a few years ago, the mortality rate due to diarrhea has dropped by 40 percent. The proper combination of three very ordinary substances generates a power that none of them possesses in isolation. The combination of the foot soldier and the work horse to produce a mounted cavalry enabled the ancient Scythians to sweep like a terror over Greece and other countries that did not know the technique of riding. The highly mobile horse soldier transformed the art of warfare and the organization of battle. The combination of the horse carriage and the motor to create the first automobiles had a similar impact. When two or more forces are combined in the proper fashion, they possess a power that is far greater than the sum of their parts. The discovery of techniques for preserving food in bottles gave Napoleon&rsquo;s army great mobility and a strategic advantage over opponents who were constantly dependent on provisions supplied from behind the lines. Gunpowder plus the sailing ship enabled Europe to dominate the entire globe. The linking of the television screen, type-writer, and silicon chip in computers has produced an enormous power for administration, research, and production&mdash;a power that none of these things possesses in isolation. When they are combined with the telephone, their power is multiplied a thousandfold, and their reach extends around the world.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same is true of people. There are some things that two people can do that a single person could never accomplish alone, no matter how long or hard the effort. Many a great kingdom was founded on the strength of a warrior king combined with the wisdom of a minister or priest. Many of today&rsquo;s great companies are the product of the fortuitous combination of a skilled inventor and a clever financier. As the number of people involved increases, the available talents, and therefore the potential power, increase exponentially rather than arithmetically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The combination of Richard Sears and Julius Rosenwald was the perfect blend for commercial success. Sears was a freewheeling promotional genius with a flair for writing advertising copy&mdash;untarnished by reality&mdash;that appealed to rural, small-town America and with a knack for making deals on closeout merchandise on especially favorable terms. But otherwise he was a poor businessman and an inept manager, with little knowledge of business finance and systematic operations. Rosenwald, on the other hand, was a person with high ethical standards and a keen insight into the needs and untapped potentials of the market. He brought to Sears the money-back guarantee and a more systematic marketing strategy. Together their abilities spurred a 13-fold growth of the fledgling mail-order business between 1895 and 1900. They were soon joined by Otto Doering, a master at operating systems. The happy confluence of these three bright stars was the alchemy that propelled a 23-fold growth of the company over the next 20 years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Alfred P. Sloan, the proverbial &quot;organization man&quot; and architect of GM&rsquo;s modern structure, once declared: &quot;After all, what any one individual can accomplish is not great, but through the power of organization the effect of a few may be multiplied almost indefinitely.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">When an individual works alone, that individual has to be everything and can succeed only to the extent that he or she possesses all the technical, administrative, managerial, and financial capacities required for the work. If the person lacks one or more of these, his or her talents will remain unutilized or wasted. But when an organization undertakes any activity, it can utilize whatever talents a single person may possess and draw on other people for the additional skills required. In every company at least 20 percent of the people will have untapped abilities that, if properly harnessed, can help it grow exponentially. Organization complements and completes the incomplete inspiration of an inventive mind or the one-sided capacities of a talented businessperson. Thus, an organization makes possible the maximum utilization of human resources.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Materials, energy, technology, money, people&mdash;when combined with each other&mdash;generate a power that none of them possesses by itself. The same is true of ideas, systems, and skills. An organization combines all of these resources in new ways to generate a virtually limitless creative power&mdash;a power that far exceeds the sum total of all its inputs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">According to scientific reports, the solar energy falling on the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere is sufficient to meet the entire world&rsquo;s energy needs 2,000 times over for the next few million years. The task of science is to discover a way to effectively harness that energy. The power of organization holds equally great potentials for humanity that are barely even glimpsed today, as the power of the atom was undreamt of until less than a century ago. When even a little of this power is released, an organization comes alive and begins to take off.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What makes an organization take off? Consider the airplane. What is the secret of its capacity for flight? Like the car or the train, its engine has a capacity for creating thrust in only one direction. Yet it is able to use this thrust to lift itself off the ground against the powerful opposition of gravity. It does this by means of wings, which convert the force resisting its forward movement into a lifting power to raise it off the ground. A slight shift in the angle of the wing makes all the difference in the world.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Organizations are similar. But whereas airplanes travel in only one direction at a time, organizations are multidimensional. They move in many directions simultaneously. As the wings of an airplane can be tilted to exactly the best angle for flight, there are countless points in an organization that can be adjusted to convert a problem, or resistance, into an opportunity, or uplifting force. When these points are touched and properly tuned, the organization comes alive and takes off. The challenge before us is to identify these points and discover how they can be made into so many wings for the company&rsquo;s ascent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Organization is the sum total of many powers, a treasure house of creative potential, a vibrant organism with an existence, life, and personality of its own. As the secrets of the human mind and heart and soul have remained unseen and concealed from the searching eye of science, mysteries as great today as ever they were in the past, humanity remains blind to another great mystery, unknown though seen by all&mdash;the unveiled enigma of the living organization. Even its founders do not know what they create. Even its leaders do not know the power they wield. Even the society it serves does not know its infinite capacity for service.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">From Cottage Handicraft to Multinational Corporation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Tomas Bata returned from the conference of Czech industrialists in 1922, he carried back with him a value and a goal. The value was a commitment to job security for his employees during a severe recession. The goal was to reduce the price of his shoes by 50 percent. The only way he could achieve either was to bring down his cost of production to less than half its present level. Like Marriott, Bata discovered the enormous hidden powers of organization. But the structure Bata adopted was quite different from Marriott&rsquo;s, because his values and objectives were different. For Marriott the central value was quality control, and the primary objective was growth. For Bata the values were employment security and cost control, and the primary objective was survival. Bata had first of all to </span><span class="c2">save</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;a business, not to build one. Despite the differences in structure, their results were remarkably similar.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bata introduced a highly decentralized structure that he termed industrial autonomy, just about the same time Alfred Sloan was introducing a decentralized structure at GM. He divided his workforce into several profit centers, each consisting of about 50 shoemakers headed by a manager, to whom authority and responsibility were delegated. He drew up a profit-sharing plan whereby each group received premiums equal to as much as 25 percent of base salary for producing more efficiently. Bata believed that maximum profitability could not be achieved by strong central controls from above. It required full motivation and the intelligent participation of every worker in the organization. He wanted every employee to feel an intense interest in producing efficiently. &quot;I want every worker to be the first book-keeper in the factory,&quot; he said. &quot;I want him to know in figures all there is to know about his job, and I want all the workers to know in figures how they fared each week. It is no use for these figures to be known by the managers alone, or to know them only once a year.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Way back in the 1920s, Bata worked out a system of </span><span class="c2">daily</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;production plans for each workshop and a rapid reporting system that fed back </span><span class="c2">hourly</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;figures on the output of shoes from each stage of production. He introduced a sophisticated costing system that enabled every worker in the leather-cutting department to monitor his or her group&rsquo;s performance and a </span><span class="c2">daily</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;financial statement that gave immediate feedback on profitability. Unlike most proprietors, he posted all these figures so everyone would be fully aware of the company&rsquo;s results.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Anthony Cekota, who joined the company in 1920, described Tomas as a man with &quot;an absolute faith in the potential power of common human effort and of unified force generated by voluntary individual resolution.&rdquo;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Half a century before quality circles, Bata wanted to turn each worker in the factory into an entrepreneur and a businessperson, who would constantly contribute new ideas on how to improve production. &quot;The autonomy of the workshops is not only less costly, but also more efficient. No one knows the obstacles to his work better than the man doing it.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;He decentralized quality control so that every worker was responsible for inspecting the work of the previous operation. This system eliminated repetition of errors, since they were caught as soon as they were made; and it created an atmosphere of peer pressure, which discouraged shoddy work by any operator.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Through this organization, Bata succeeded in enlisting the interest and releasing the energies of his employees. Between 1922, when he introduced it, and 1932, when he died in an airplane crash, his company expanded from 2,200 employees producing about 8,000 pairs of shoes a day to 18,200 employees producing 144,000 pairs. A 9-fold increase in workforce generated an 18-fold increase in production. Productivity had doubled. At the same time, the average weekly wages of Bata&rsquo;s workers rose more than 3-fold, while Bata&rsquo;s sale prices dropped to one-sixth their 1922 level. Even during the worst years of the Great Depression, Bata continued to expand. By 1932 the company was manufacturing shoes in 28 countries. That was the power of Bata&rsquo;s organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bata had said, &quot;I wanted something which functions as naturally and automatically as sunrise and sunset,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;and his organization did, even after his death. It not only functioned; it grew right through the 1930s. When protectionist pressures increased, making it more difficult to export shoes from Czechoslovakia, the company concentrated on development of its overseas branches in England, Germany, Canada, India, and many other countries.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Perpetual-Motion Machine</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The real test of the Bata Shoe organization was yet to come. In the fall of 1938, Czechoslovakia was first dismembered at the Munich Conference and the rest of it invaded by Germany in March 1939. All communications with the outside world were cut off. Young Thomas Bata was in Western Europe at the time and then proceeded to Canada, where he managed to gather round him a few other Bata Shoe Company executives who had been able to leave Czechoslovakia before the Nazi invasion. During the course of the war, no civilian communication was possible between this group and the parent company or most of the overseas companies. When the war ended, the Communists seized power in Czechoslovakia and appropriated all the assets of the Bata Shoe Company. Almost the entire Bata staff was trapped forever within the country.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1945 Thomas Bata called a meeting in Canada of his country managers from all over the world to find out what remained of what had once been the world&rsquo;s largest shoe company. To his surprise, he discovered that in most of the countries where it had manufacturing facilities, the firm was thriving. Tomas Bata&rsquo;s goal of an organization that would function automatically had been achieved. The autonomy of local profit centers had evolved into a decentralized structure of autonomous country operations, which functioned efficiently without any direction from the head office. Although the company&rsquo;s production had fallen to 40 percent of the prewar level&mdash;from 55 million to 20 million pairs&mdash;within five years Bata was once again the largest manufacturer of footwear in the world.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Since the end of the war, the company has extended its operations to 93 countries, where it now produces 300 million pairs of shoes annually; but it still retains the decentralized structure developed 60 years ago. As Chairman Thomas Bata says, &quot;The thing is being held together by local dynamism rather than by any constant edicts from a center.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">With such a highly decentralized operation, how does the parent company maintain any semblance of a unified organization at all? Despite the local autonomy, there is an extraordinary degree of similarity between the operations in different plants and different countries. There is also a strong sense of discipline throughout the company. This consistency and discipline are maintained by a uniform set of systems, procedures, and forms used by every Bata operation worldwide. A supervisor from Bata&rsquo;s plant at Calcutta will feel completely at home with the systems employed in the Bata plants in Casablanca; Kampala; Bangkok; Panama; Lima; or Belcamp, Maryland. A store manager from Khartoum will recognize the form used for inventory by a store in Mexico, even if he or she cannot read Spanish, because except for the language, it is exactly the same. Uniformity is reinforced by the system of rotating country managers every few years, so that any new idea developed in one country quickly spreads to others. Sitting with a group of country managers from Australia, Kenya, and Sudan, we were surprised by the similarity of their remarks on issues like cleanliness, punctuality, and inventory control. Today, if an employee in any Bata company is late to work, he or she will be reprimanded. The chairman&rsquo;s assistant told us of the scolding he received for being one minute late on several occasions. There is no written rule or system to enforce punctuality. In fact, few people even know exactly how it became so important. Actually, time-consciousness was one of Tomas Bata&rsquo;s highest priorities, and the value has been transmitted through the decades. &quot;You cannot fly an airplane slowly,&quot; he used to say. &quot;The worst kind of waste and most costly waste is time waste, because it is invisible.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt69" id="ftnt_ref69">[69]</a></sup><span class="c73 c41 c71">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Punctuality at Bata no longer requires the support of rules, procedures, and systems. It has become a custom of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The original profit centers still exist in Bata factories all over the world&mdash;even the employee cafeterias are run as separate profit centers within each plant. The system of hourly and daily financial reporting introduced by the founder continues as well. Every morning Bata executives in Toronto meet to discuss production and sales figures coming in from around the world. The reporting system has been an important tool for staying in touch with overseas operations and for exercising control, wherever necessary.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In spite of their marked differences, the organizations created by the Marriotts and the Batas have several things in common. Both combine centralization in some areas with decentralization in others. Both employ well-developed systems to maintain uniformity and consistency. Both impose strict discipline in some areas to maintain control. Both allow wide freedom in other areas to encourage entrepreneurship and individual initiative. Marriott&rsquo;s highly centralized organization and Bata&rsquo;s highly decentralized one appear at closer range as variations on a single model. The power they have both discovered issues more from organization itself than from the particular form that organization takes in one company or another.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It was not the market that fueled the expansion of these two companies; it was the release of forces from within themselves. They were not driven by the potentials of the market, but by the limitless potentials of organization, to which the market responded. They did not have to seek out opportunities in life. They discovered opportunities within the organization, and life unfolded more rich potentials than either of them ever dreamed of.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Character</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is this thing that we call organization? It is actually the organizing and executing will of the corporate personality. It is the </span><span class="c2">character</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of the corporation. In the individual, character collects, harnesses, and directs all the energies and capacities of the personality to fulfill its quest for self-actualization. Corporate character works the same way. It gathers together, mobilizes, and directs all the resources of the company to fulfill the values, mission, and objectives of the psychic center. It is the link between idea and action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The character of an organization has two aspects, one structural and the other functional. The structural aspect determines the form of the organization, the hierarchy of levels. It is like the skeletal system in the human body, which determines the size and shape of the body and provides a structure to which the muscles are attached and in which the organs rest. The structure of an organization&mdash;with its various departments, divisions, and levels of hierarchy&mdash;plays a similar role. In another sense, the structure of an organization is like the circulatory system in the body, consisting of a matrix of interconnecting vessels of various diameters. These vessels are the channels or path-ways through which energy, information, money, and materials are transported within the company. The size of each vessel determines how much it can carry. Its connections with other vessels determine the destination of the things it transports.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But this structure constitutes only the passive and external component of corporate character, the one depicted in organization charts. Character also has an active functional aspect. It exercises authority. This functional aspect is like the field general who is in charge of directing an army during battle. The broad aims and objectives of the war, as well as the strategy to be pursued in the battle, are established by the chief of staff. The field general&rsquo;s task is to execute the battle plan according to the plans and strategies received from above. That task involves coordinating the actions of armored divisions, artillery, air support, and infantry to ensure that they act in unison and not at cross-purposes; without the field general, the movements of these various forces might not coincide properly, and there is even the possibility of aerial or artillery bombardment&rsquo;s endangering the general&rsquo;s own army, a thing quite common in war and not unheard of in business.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In this sense, character is the organizing and executing will of the corporate personality that releases all its energies, mobilizes all its resources, and coordinates all its actions to fulfill its mission and objectives in accordance with its central beliefs and values. It does not fix the goals&mdash;that is done by the psychic center&mdash;but it directs all the company&rsquo;s capacities to realize them. People, ideas, skills, systems, money, technology, machinery, and materials are like the armed forces that the field general commands. In the absence of a central authority, they tend to act on their own, independently of the rest and often in conflict with one another.</span></p><a id="id.m7znf3pyhng6"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The corporate character establishes a hierarchy of levels and exercises authority for the execution of work. It imposes common rules, regulations, standards, and strategies on the various departments and divisions. It coordinates the activity of all the company&rsquo;s resources and integrates activities at different levels of the company to ensure smooth and harmonious operations. It is the central will or authority for the execution of work. (Figure 2 depicts the role of the corporate character in the corporate personality.) In the absence of a strong corporate character, top management decisions are not properly executed, employee discipline and morale are low, departments and divisions are in frequent conflict and work at cross-purposes, human talents and physical resources are not fully utilized, systems function poorly or in isolation from each other, and market potentials remain untapped.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 285.00px; height: 279.00px;"><img alt="The role of the corporate character in the corporate personality" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 285.00px; height: 279.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><a id="id.6g4v6zlk8ycx"></a></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c41">Figure 2 &nbsp;The role of the corporate character in the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Hierarchy and Authority</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is the source of an organization&rsquo;s incredible power? There is not one source, but many. When Bill Marriott, Sr., ran Hot Shoppe No. 1 with the help of his wife, Allie, and a few employees, he was all things to his business&mdash;a worker, a supervisor of others&rsquo; work, and a decision-making manager. When Hot Shoppe No. 2 was added, he and Allie could station themselves simultaneously or successively in one shop or the other carrying out the same functions as before. But when Nos. 3, 4, and 5 were added, Bill&rsquo;s job changed in character. It was no longer possible for him to personally oversee all the work going on in all the shops all the time. Therefore, Bill had to select one from among the group of employees at each shop to act as an extension of his senses and watch over things in his absence. Bill ceased to be a worker or even a supervisor. He now had to devote most of his time to making decisions and leave supervision to someone permanently located at each shop. Gradually, he found it possible to delegate decision-making authority on routine items of work to his shop supervisors, thereby freeing himself from most of the repetitive, ordinary operational decisions so that he could concentrate his attention on general management issues like finding locations for additional shops or thinking up some new advertising strategy. In the process, his supervisors were upgraded into managers. Bill&rsquo;s evolution from worker to supervisor to manager to general manager coincided with the establishment of a multitiered hierarchy in his company and the delegation of authority to personnel at lower levels of the organization. The net result was an enormous increase in his personal productivity and a fivefold expansion of the business. The creation of a hierarchical structure and the delegation of authority are two of the primary powers of organization.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Specialization and Systems</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Tomas Bata started his business, shoemaking in Czechoslovakia was still a cottage handicraft in which each cobbler performed all of the tasks involved in making shoes, usually in the family kitchen. Inspired by the idea of mass production, Bata took a group of people and divided their work into specialized tasks along a production line. This division of labor made them each far more productive and efficient than any individual cobbler. It enabled Tomas and his father to start their business in 1894 with 50 employees instead of one cobbler and to expand to 120 by 1900. Specialization is another primary power of organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Although technology was gradually changing shoemaking from a manual into a machine-driven trade, the organization of production still followed the old pattern of the cobbler&rsquo;s shop. Bata introduced new machinery and developed a lot of his own, but his real innovation was the Bata system. He introduced automated production conveyors as Ford did for cars. Then he developed innumerable systems for procurement of raw materials, inventory control, planning, production, distribution, and marketing. These systems enabled him to produce far more efficiently than the machine-driven factories based on the traditional pattern. He also introduced various types of records and reports, which enabled him to supervise, monitor, and control a far larger operation. Systems and reporting are also fundamental powers of organization. They enabled Bata to expand his daily production another tenfold between 1900 and 1910.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Coordination and Integration</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As Bata&rsquo;s business expanded, it came to encompass a whole series of related activities, which no individual cobbler minus an organization could undertake. Bata sent out purchasing officers to scour the country&mdash;and, later, foreign countries&mdash;in search of good-quality, low-priced leather. He established tanneries so that he could process the leather himself. He set up machine shops to build and repair his equipment. He developed more efficient means of transporting his shoes to the market. He created new channels of wholesale and retail distribution within the country and overseas. All these activities had to be closely coordinated in order to ensure a smooth flow of work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bata&rsquo;s organization also expanded vertically to include several more layers between the proprietor and his executives at the top and the thousands of purchasing agents, production workers, technicians, salespeople, and clerks at the bottom. It became essential to integrate activities at each level with those above and below, to ensure that what the planners decided was carried out at all the lower levels in all departments within the country and overseas and to ensure that all significant events at lower levels were reported and acted upon by management.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination ensures that the hand and mouth work in unison. Integration ensures that the mouth eats what the mind approves, the taste enjoys, and the body can digest. Coordination and integration are higher powers of the organization that unfolded for Bata a rich creative potential for growth. Daily production in 1932 was nearly 50 times greater than it was in 1910 and 3,000 times greater than it was in 1894. Productivity per worker had grown from an average of one pair of shoes per day to an average of eight pairs per day.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Harmony</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Marriott underwent a similar line of horizontal expansion and vertical development. It gradually expanded its activities from root beer to Mexican food, from drive-in restaurants to in-flight service, from hotels to life-care communities. As it grew, it also developed a much deeper hierarchy than the three-tiered structure that ran the first Hot Shoppes. This growth was made possible by the close coordination of related activities and the integration of different levels of the organization through a sophisticated matrix of systems for reporting, monitoring, controlling, and executing work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination and integration enable Marriott to operate a wide range of businesses and expand rapidly while maintaining high standards of service. For instance, the hotel division has opened between 10 and 20 major hotels every year for the last five years and had them operating up to Marriott standards almost immediately.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When structure and systems are coordinated and integrated, as at Marriott, the organization begins to function like a well-tuned Mercedes engine or a precisely made Rolex watch. Movements become smooth and swift. Interactions are frictionless and trouble-free. Productivity increases enormously. Frustration, irritation, conflict, and confrontation are minimized. People become relaxed, even-tempered, cooperative, and cheerful. An atmosphere of harmony is established.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One of the things that impressed us about Marriott was that the firm&rsquo;s friendly, personalized service is delivered through a highly complex system of procedures and controls. The smooth-running systems make everyone&rsquo;s job clearer and easier. They reduce friction and confusion. As one vice-president explained, &quot;We try to develop systems that help make an experience pleasant instead of detracting from it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Harmony depends on recruiting the right kind of people, imparting the right kind of training, and communicating the right values and attitudes to all employees. Harmony, too, is a power of organization&mdash;potentially more powerful than all those that come before it and make it possible&mdash;because when harmony is present, employees will go to great lengths to serve, and customers will go to great lengths to seek out that service.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Greater Powers</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Hierarchy, delegation of authority, specialization, systems, coordination, integration, and harmony are some of the powers of organization that have been discovered and harnessed by modern corporations to accomplish incredible feats of growth and productivity. But these are still the lesser powers. There are greater ones as well&mdash;powers that come from people. What, after all, is an organization other than people? &quot;People are the key to everything,&quot; says Thomas Bata. &quot;The key to success is &hellip; people. Management is nothing more than motivating people,&quot; wrote Iacocca.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt70" id="ftnt_ref70">[70]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Money, technology, raw materials, products, and systems come to life and generate power only because of the people who wield them. Walt LeSueur, director of sales administration at General Mills, summed it up best: &quot;All we&rsquo;ve got here is flour and water and people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For thousands of years great leaders have searched for the key to the infinite power of people. The pharaohs resorted to force and fear of death to mobilize people to work. But all they obtained was the merest physical labor in return for a minimum level of sustenance. Napoleon succeeded for a while in winning the hearts of his young, illtrained recruits with the glorious battle cry &quot;Vive la France.&quot; Gandhi awakened an entire nation and made it rise up unarmed against the might of the British Empire with the inspiring call for the liberation of Mother India. But these were only brief moments in history, when a leader or an ambition or an event released the powers latent in people, more often for destruction than for creation. The real challenge is to release those powers for continuous production.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Discipline</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How do organizations harness the power of people? They do it through an effort of will, through the exercise of authority. The real character of a corporation is expressed in the way it exercises authority, the manner in which it exerts its will to influence people. Every organization must exercise authority in order to survive. There was a time when this was done almost entirely through negative means, through discipline and threat of punishment. Today discipline is not a very popular concept; yet no organization can exist without it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Lee Iacocca arrived at Chrysler for his very first day on the job, he observed several clear signs that the organization was in deep trouble.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c8">&hellip;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the office of the president </span><span class="c8">&hellip;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;was being used as a thoroughfare to get from one office to another. I watched in amazement as executives with coffee cups in their hands kept opening the door and walking right through the president&rsquo;s office. Right away I knew the place was in a state of anarchy. Chrysler needed a dose of order and discipline&mdash;and quick</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt71" id="ftnt_ref71">[71]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Without discipline, the energies and talents of an organization cannot be fully harnessed and put to work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every company, even the most people-oriented, has areas where it insists on obedience and discipline. Wherever high performance levels are considered absolutely critical, negative forms of authority are employed. At Du Pont the surest way to get fired is to ignore safety regulations. At Merck it is to give erroneous or exaggerated information to a physician. At Bata, if any inventory is found missing from a company-owned store, the store manager is personally responsible for compensating the company for the loss. Sears really means business about the way customers are to be handled. Mistreating a customer is a quick way out the door.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">IBM has been known for its Marinelike discipline since the days when Tom Watson, Sr., forbade his employees to drink alcohol on or off the job&mdash;even prior to national Prohibition&mdash;discouraged smoking among his employees, and insisted that salespeople wear dark business suits and white shirts. Although the Watsons are gone, the codes of behavior remain, and most of them are still in force. The old dress code is no longer a strict regulation, but most IBM sales reps stick to it. Drinking off the job is a personal matter now, but those who drink at lunch are expected to take the rest of the day off.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When it comes to business ethics, there is no compromise allowed at IBM. The company has a 32-page code of business ethics, which employees must strictly adhere to. As IBM&rsquo;s director of management development commented: &quot;If anybody does anything that is the least bit shady, the heavens descend on them &hellip; People see we have a basic set of beliefs and we adhere to them.&quot; The strength of this commitment &quot;elevates the whole company,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt72" id="ftnt_ref72">[72]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;says Frederick W. Zuckerman, who worked 12 years at IBM before joining Lee Iacocca&rsquo;s management team at Chrysler.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At IBM the commitment to after-sale service is taken so seriously that the company considers it a grave lapse if any one of its customers give up IBM equipment in favor of another brand. IBM has a policy to ensure that account representatives fully understand the importance of follow-up customer service and act on it. If an IBM customer switches to another brand, the present account representative for the customer&rsquo;s territory has to refund to the company out of his or her salary and bonus the full amount of the commission paid on that customer&rsquo;s original order, even if that commission had been paid to a previous representative who is no longer covering the same territory.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Soon after taking over as president of a middle-sized corporation, a former IBM vice-president launched a program to cut overheads. During one of the executive meetings, he asked for a copy of the individual records maintained by all executives for long-distance calls from company phones. The executives looked at the new president in surprise and bewilderment, and one of them asked, &quot;Do they keep such records at IBM?&quot; The president replied, &quot;Of course, they do. Don&rsquo;t you do it here?&quot; To which another executive responded, &quot;We are trying to follow the latest practices here. We never thought that companies like IBM still did such things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Intel</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Companies vary enormously in the degree to which they resort to discipline as well as the manner of discipline. When IBM acquired 12 percent of Intel&rsquo;s stock in 1983, some considered it a strange match&mdash;straitlaced IBM and informal Intel, where executive attire consists of sport shirts and no ties. But IBM and Intel do have one thing very much in common&mdash;discipline. Discipline at Intel is a serious matter. The workday starts at 8 A.M. If any employee comes in after 8:05, he or she has to sign in on the &quot;late list&quot; in order to get by the guard&mdash;even if the employee happens to be the president. Repeated tardiness is grounds for dismissal. Cofounder Robert Noyce once remarked: &quot;Intel is the only place I have ever worked where an 8:00 A.M. meeting starts at 8:00 A.M.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Part of the rationale for this discipline is that when one person is late, other people&rsquo;s work may be affected. At most Intel meetings over 90 percent of the people will be there at the appointed hour, and the rest will usually be less than five minutes late. Intel is in an industry where you just cannot wait.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Intel is also in an industry in which you have to be clean, at least in the plants where the chips are made. In Intel&rsquo;s plants cleanliness is an absolute must; chips are manufactured in an environment where the air is a hundred times cleaner than the air in a hospital operating room. So far, it all makes sense. But cleanliness at Intel does not stop there. It spills over into the administrative environment, too. About twice a month, teams of three or four people in each building inspect every work station and rank it in terms of cleanliness. Composite scores are calculated for each building. &quot;Mr. Clean,&quot; as the teams are called, is quite effective. Financial and administrative officers at most companies are known for their cluttered desks, but Intel&rsquo;s Larry Hootnick keeps his office so neat and orderly that we actually could not find a single piece of paper in sight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is also a corrective action program at Intel. Any employee who does not perform up to expectations is called in for a discussion, and a specific program is drawn up to solve the problem. Ninety days later performance is reviewed to determine whether the program has been successful. If it has not, the employee better look for a new job, either inside or outside the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are also semiannual reviews of hourly employees and annual reviews of salaried personnel, in which the individual is rated on a scale ranging from &quot;superior&quot; to &quot;does not meet requirements.&quot; Even superior performers will have areas where they can improve, and individual programs will be charted out for that purpose.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This does not mean that there is always someone looking over your shoulder at Intel. Discipline has become institutionalized as a custom. Although there are rules and peer pressure, to a great extent discipline has been internalized as a self-critical attitude in people. Rebecca Wallo, of the company&rsquo;s public information department, explained: &quot;The people are very self-critical here. If you talk to people who have been here awhile, they would say they are as critical of themselves as they would expect others to be.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Financial control is an area that is strictly enforced at almost all the companies we visited. Travel expenses must be precisely accounted for. Bills for long-distance calls are monitored to eliminate unnecessary or unsanctioned use of the phone. At Intel nobody, including the chairman, flies first class. The same is true at Marriott, where even Bill Marriott, Jr., flies economy class.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0 c7">Delta</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have already referred to the strict cost control at Delta, but in nonfinancial matters Delta is not exactly the sort of company you would associate with strict discipline. Then, again, companies are not quite so stereotyped as we often portray them. When it comes to Delta&rsquo;s core values, the company does not compromise.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The personal appearance of flight attendants is governed by fairly strict regulations. Being overweight is grounds for dismissal, because good service depends so much on an attendant&rsquo;s agility in narrow, crowded aisles. For men, whether or not to wear a tie &quot;isn&rsquo;t one of the things you can decide on. You wear it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Punctuality is also an important value at Delta, because it is a critical factor in providing on-time customer service. Delta has the lowest delayed-flight rates in the industry. There is no late list, but if an employee comes in late five times, his or her manager will sit down with the employee to find out what the problem is. About 95 percent of the people arrive before the 8:00 A.M. opening time and return from lunch promptly by 1:00 P.M. There is a strong atmosphere of peer pressure at Delta. Even if the boss is not around, other employees are. &quot;If the boss doesn&rsquo;t know, the troops know,&quot; remarked Dennis Schmidt, general manager for methods and training. &quot;If people have not held up their end of the deal and they are looking for support, they won&rsquo;t find it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Managers deal with individual problems like punctuality on a one-to-one basis with the individual rather than by an impersonal memo or a 90-day written contract for improvement. Delta practices what it calls &quot;progressive discipline&quot;&mdash;in which the individual and his or her manager work together to clearly understand what the problem is and devise ways to remove it. We asked President Ron Allen what is the best way for an employee to get in trouble at Delta. &quot;Acts of dishonesty,&quot; he replied. &quot;That&rsquo;s something that we don&rsquo;t tolerate.&quot; Although discipline is enforced in many areas, sometimes Delta&rsquo;s own employees feel the company is not being tough enough. One executive commented, &quot;Our people tell us we go too far in giving employees a second, third, and fourth chance to change.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Delta tries to enforce discipline less through the threat of punishment than through what it calls &quot;an atmosphere of approval.&quot; There is a positive milieu in which everybody knows what is expected and is motivated to live up to the standard. Allen says: &quot;We don&rsquo;t want people to be afraid that if they don&rsquo;t come to work on time or don&rsquo;t do this or that, then they will really get in trouble. Instead we want them to feel good about doing things correctly and giving of their best. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that people don&rsquo;t get in trouble at Delta, but we want our managers to manage people through this environment of approval. It is the value of the person. Our managers recognize the value of the individual.&quot; One past president of Delta summed up the company&rsquo;s policy this way: &quot;You can do anything around here that you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get fired for.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Freedom Versus Laxity</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Recently a lot of attention has been paid in management circles to the value of using positive reinforcement through rewards and attention to motivate people and get work done rather than negative reinforcement through fear and punishment. But this should not obscure the critical importance of maintaining discipline. As a rule, the more developed the corporate personality becomes, the more clearly defined are the policies, rules, and procedures for monitoring and enforcing authority in areas of central importance. The form of authority and the manner of enforcing it may vary with the character of the corporation, as Intel differs from Delta, but the critical commitment to discipline will be there. Companies that feel it is &quot;unprogressive&quot; to insist on punctuality and accurate travel accounts, or look the other way when staff members bypass traditional lines of authority, mistakenly confuse laxity and indiscipline with the freedom necessary to achieve enduring success. The two are vastly different concepts. Even when a company gets away with lax discipline in a few instances or for a short while, it tends to undermine the whole edifice of organizational character. A breath of fresh air may seep in through a crack in the hull of a surfaced submarine, bringing relief to the crew in a stuffy engine room; but when the ship is submerged, water will pour in through the same crack.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">The Dividing Line</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How, then, should we understand all the talk about positive reinforcement, freedom, autonomy, individual initiative, open doors, informal communications, flexible working hours, visible management, and the like, which are practiced with apparent success by many of the most respected corporations? Discipline and freedom are the two ways in which the corporate character exercises its will to accomplish work&mdash;one by restricting employees&rsquo; freedom of action, the other by asking employees to practice self-restraint.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Discipline and freedom are both essential, and in mature corporations they complement each other. Discipline, which is authority physically imposed from above, is insisted on in areas central to the organization&rsquo;s existence, where employees cannot be relied upon to always function in the prescribed manner on their own initiative. Freedom, which is self-imposed authority exercised by the individual over himself or herself, is extended in areas where employees are obedient and cooperative and have already accepted the need to act with self-control and a sense of responsibility in conformity with the higher values and goals of the corporation. Peters and Waterman found that America&rsquo;s best-run companies &quot;are on the one hand rigidly controlled, yet at the same time allow (indeed, insist on) autonomy, entrepreneurship, and innovation from the rank and file.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The proper dividing line between discipline and freedom, between negative and positive forms of authority, depends on social custom, geographic location, the laws governing employment, the extent of the employees&rsquo; economic dependence on the firm, and alternative job opportunities; but most especially it depends on the strength of the corporate character. If every American company abolished time clocks and fixed working hours and removed the locks on their laboratory storerooms as Hewlett-Packard has down, a good number would find their factories empty, except on pay day, and their storerooms permanently vacant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Positive forms of authority are successful in proportion to the general level of education of employees, their technical capabilities and job satisfaction, and the extent to which a supportive milieu of team-work, peer pressure, loyalty, and commitment to the company has developed among the employees. There is no clear dividing line for one and all. It depends on the company, and it depends on the stage of the company&rsquo;s development. Forty-five years ago General Wood addressed a conference of Sears store managers on this subject. He said that in order for a decentralized structure based on freedom for individual initiative to work, &quot;there must be self-imposed discipline. You as Managers must discipline yourselves, otherwise discipline has to be applied from above.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Wood had learned this lesson well from his predecessor, Julius Rosenwald. During the prosperous years of World War I, when Rosenwald was away assisting with the war effort, lax discipline set in at Sears. Then came the postwar recession, and the company almost went bankrupt. Insisting on discipline where freedom is effective cancels opportunities and retards growth; but relying on freedom where discipline is required can destroy the company altogether.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In a well-balanced organization, the foundations and structure are established by discipline and control, while expansion and development are based on self-discipline and freedom. Survival and preservation are imposed from above; growth and dynamism are released from below. The company that fully establishes discipline in all core sectors and fully enlists the cooperation and self-restraint of its employees for expansion functions successfully at the peak of performance. Its opportunities for growth are endless.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Perpetual Youth</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For years America&rsquo;s leading business schools have been teaching their MBA candidates about the theory of product life cycles. Products, like people, are born, grow, become old, and die. It is certainly true that many products have behaved according to this theory. The Model T lived a long life; the Edsel, a very short one. But at General Mills it is the theory that has died, not the products. &quot;There is no such thing as a product life-cycle,&quot; insists the firm&rsquo;s vice-president and general manager, Ned Bixby.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;General Mills is still pushing Cheerios, Bisquick, and Gold Medal flour&mdash;all of which are as old as or older than Betty Crocker herself and look nearly as young. Like the face of Betty Crocker, these products are continually updated to keep in step with the times. Fifty years after its birth, Cheerios is America&rsquo;s leading breakfast cereal in dollar volume.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is the secret of this perpetual renewal that has made General Mills the most profitable and admired company in its industry? General Mills has learned how to harness the creative power of people through positive authority. It all began in 1928, when James Bell, the president of a 60-year-old flour mill, consolidated five independent companies to create the largest flour-milling company in the world, General Mills. The mills were all well-established operations spread throughout the country, so there was no need to centralize their management and little advantage in doing so. After the merger, the mills continued to operate very much as before, like independent entrepreneurial businesses.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bell believed that a corporation&rsquo;s most important asset was its people rather than the figures set down in its balance sheet. He valued intelligence, enthusiasm, and aggressiveness more than money. His goal was to preserve the local autonomy of the mills while giving them the support of a centralized national organization with research, production, training, packaging, and merchandising expertise. &quot;Our aim,&quot; he said, &quot;is to give the maximum of help to our associates with the minimum of interference.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As General Mills grew over the years, Bell applied the same philosophy not only to the proprietors of the previously independent mills but to all employees in the organization. His objective was to release enthusiasm, initiative, and enterprise as far down the line as possible, to foster a process of perpetual self-renewal in the company. Bell said: &quot;New and young blood must flow steadily through the veins of any successful company. It is the spirit of our organization to keep the way to the top open and to keep the young men alert to opportunity by developing their sense of responsibility.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In 1965 General Ed Rawlings closed 9 of the company&rsquo;s remaining 17 flour mills, thereby surrendering the title &quot;world&rsquo;s largest.&quot; Although the mills went, the company&rsquo;s basic character remained. Rawlings stayed with the decentralized structure and the entrepreneurial atmosphere, but he added new systems for planning and control in order to increase coordination throughout the company. His aim was to combine individual initiative with teamwork, two organizational powers that rarely are found together. &quot;The full effect of our system is yet to be felt,&quot; he once claimed. He was certainly right.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;During the following two decades, General Mills set a course that was defined in terms of &quot;continuity and change.&quot; This meant steadfast adherence to principles of conduct combined with a willingness to initiate change as dictated by the external marketplace and by internal strategic goals. The result was tenfold growth to a $5.6 billion enterprise, focusing on three business areas&mdash;consumer foods, restaurants, and specialty retailing.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Free Spirit and Incorrigible Entrepreneur</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When you enter the home of Betty Crocker, you somehow expect to find an atmosphere as old as the name&mdash;traditional, conservative, and more than a little stodgy. But that image hardly fits General Mills today, any more than the first portrait of Betty Crocker in 1936 resembles her latest remodeling. The company may be old in years, but it is very young in spirit. The atmosphere is intense, alive, saturated with a wholesome vitality and dynamism. It feels more like a gymnasium than a kitchen. Its employees are reminiscent of John Wooden&rsquo;s fast-break, full-court-press basketball teams at UCLA during the 1960s&mdash;competitive team players with high morale.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most visible expression of the company&rsquo;s exuberant atmosphere is the brand manager system. Every year the company recruits about 40 graduates of the nation&rsquo;s top business schools. In the first year the new recruits may be assigned to one of those products that the theorists say should not exist anymore. Old-timers like Wheaties (introduced in 1924), Cheerios, and Kix (circa 1940) are reinvigorated and rejuvenated by the energy, enthusiasm, ambition, and ideas of a youthful MBA. The product may be half a century old, but for the fledgling marketing assistant it is brand new. The advertising budget may be well structured and controlled, but for someone right out of graduate school, helping to manage it is a big responsibility and a big challenge. The marketing assistants also realize that experienced marketing professionals with General Mills can earn a performance bonus of 20 percent or more on what is already a handsome base salary. Couple these factors with the knowledge that a significant percent of the new marketing assistant&rsquo;s &quot;classmates&quot; will not be with the company a year or two later&mdash;either because some could not make the grade or stand the speed or because they were lured away by one of the many companies that prize General Mills&rsquo; &quot;graduates&quot;&mdash;and you have a formula for dynamic action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A recent issue of the company&rsquo;s employee publication carries a cartoon of a young marketing assistant with briefcase in hand flying through the office. The cartoon is entitled &quot;General Milieu.&quot; That pretty well captures the atmosphere. Maybe the brand managers do not have very much real authority. Perhaps often they do not really do anything very different from the way their predecessors operated&mdash;just a little change in the package here or in the advertisement there. But that little bit of alchemy is often enough to transmute an aging product into a rising star, and so the process of renewal is repeated year after year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The system often fails, with old products and new ones, but failure is not something that is frowned on too much at General Mills. As one executive put it, &quot;We fail more than others, because we try more new things.&quot; The positive atmosphere does result in more than an equal number of success stories. The company still makes acquisitions, but usually small ones that it builds up. Over $1.5 billion of General Mills&rsquo; revenues in 1984, and about one-third of its profits, came from eight operations that had average sales of only $8 million in their first year with the company. In 1977 a little cottage cheese factory in Michigan with a French recipe for yogurt was purchased for $3 million. It is now a $150 million product called Yoplait.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One thing that struck us about the company was the apparent invisibility of top management, which was expressed as an enormous latitude of freedom for personal growth at lower levels. After listening for a while to Chris Steiner, a marketing director in the foods division who joined the company as a marketing assistant eight years ago, we began to wonder who actually runs this place or if anyone really does. Steiner constantly referred to &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot; but never once mentioned any &quot;they&quot; who sit above her and tell her and her colleagues what to do. &quot;There is nobody looking down over your head and asking you if you did this or that,&quot; she explained. The same view of management was expressed by John Machuzick, a sales operations manager in Grocery Products Sales. &quot;They let people run their own businesses. They get involved in the major decisions, but for the everyday business going on, we are allowed to make the decisions. Young managers have a lot of authority in this company.&quot; It requires an enormous self-restraint and confidence to give freedom for others to make decisions and act. That is the corporate character of General Mills and one of the keys to its continuing momentum and enduring success.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The entrepreneurial spirit at General Mills is not confined to consumer foods or even the marketing end of that organization. Innovation and entrepreneurship pervade the entire organization. In manufacturing, innovation is encouraged at the very lowest level. Small teams study problems that individually may not involve more than $1,000 in operating costs, in an effort to improve efficiency. In the process, people get involved and enthused, and they begin to think creatively. In another striking example of the entrepreneurial spirit, the company was one of the first to employ a whole series of new investment techniques. Treasurer Jim Weaver proudly explains how he earned excellent returns on arbitrage transactions involving zero-coupon bonds popular in the Eurobond market.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Discipline by Objectives</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Discipline</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is a word you do not hear much at General Mills. Authority is felt as a constant pressure to excel. &quot;The company makes great demands on us,&quot; Chris Steiner explained. &quot;They demand excellence in terms of the product and the profit. So there is always that kind of demand. You&rsquo;ve got to do it better.&quot; The company relies more on an atmosphere of expectation than on rules and regulations to enforce appropriate conduct. Executive Vice-President Paul Parker confirmed: &quot;We are loose and relaxed. Peer pressure will force people into a proper behavior pattern.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A lot of the pressure at General Mills issues from the commitment to the company&rsquo;s financial objectives&mdash;a return on equity of 19 percent or more and an annual growth rate at least 6 percent above the rate of inflation. The company has maintained a five-year compound growth rate of 11.3 percent in earnings per share. In a slow-growing field, this performance has made it what </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;called &quot;the toast of the industry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The company is very serious about meeting its financial goals. Separate profit and loss statements are maintained for each product, retail store, and restaurant. &quot;The object is to make running a General Mills company as much like running a free-standing business as possible,&quot; according to the company&rsquo;s chairman, Bruce Atwater.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;&quot;Profit responsibility is fundamental. If a product manager has it, it pushes him into manufacturing efficiencies, productivity gains, ingredient substitutions, and anticipating commodity fluctuations.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The systems and controls for financial reporting constitute one area where discipline is rigorously enforced. &quot;We do insist on very stringent rules in the accounting and control function,&quot; Parker said. &quot;There is no deviation. You have to have figures you can trust.&quot; When we asked Steiner how people get in trouble at General Mills, she echoed the same view. &quot;If you aren&rsquo;t honest with someone, if you try to hide something or misrepresent information, that is the only thing I can think of that leads to real serious trouble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Despite the go-go pace of the brand manager system, the people are surprisingly warm, relaxed, informal, and friendly at General Mills. They really seem to enjoy their work and feel excited about it rather than feeling the stress and strain of a highly competitive race. Freedom, individual involvement, and enormous opportunities for personal growth mitigate the pressures of the fast pace.</span></p><p class="c4 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Material Incentives</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The key to General Mills&rsquo; youthful exuberance is its ability to release the energies of its employees through positive rather than negative means. The positive forms of authority fall into a gradation ranging from purely material incentives to purely psychological ones. The basis of positive authority is attention to people, recognition of achievement, respect for the individual, and freedom for self-expression. Its most common form is the use of material rewards to motivate people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For a long time it was commonly believed that monetary incentives were the key to maximizing individual performance. General Mills employs generous monetary incentives; but long before most companies, it recognized that nonmaterial, or psychological, incentives can motivate as nothing else can. Tom Watson, Sr., made the same discovery more than 50 years ago. He converted all factory workers at IBM from piece rate to salaries while expanding the scope and enriching the content of their jobs to the maximum. Many people expected productivity to fall after these changes were introduced, while actually output per worker continued to climb right through the depression and even during the war years, when productivity was declining in most other industries in spite of higher wages.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The major limitation of material incentives is that they relate only to people&rsquo;s performance, not to the people themselves. Like the threat of punishment, which motivates only so long as there is a chance of getting caught, monetary incentives motivate primarily in areas where achievement is measurable and likely to be rewarded. They are also limited by a person&rsquo;s ambition and expectations. Those strange stories we have heard about people in developing countries who work only as hard as is necessary to sustain their present economic level are not so strange or foreign as they may seem. Many people&mdash;executives included&mdash;are quite satisfied with their present standard of living and beyond that point cannot be easily motivated by financial rewards. In addition, monetary incentives are inherently limited by the economic costs involved in continuous salary increments.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Social Incentives</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Attention to people and recognition of achievement are also given through a variety of nonmaterial ways, ranging from a simple pat on the back for a job well done to promotion to a position with greater status, responsibilities, or decision-making authority. These forms of recognition are not limited either by economic constraints on the company or by the ambitions and expectations of the individual. Everyone responds positively to attention and recognition from his or her boss, peers, or subordinates. We all have an unquenchable thirst for social approval.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This is the reason for the success of all the unorthodox and non-traditional techniques now being used to motivate people, such as recognition for heroes and champions and collective rituals like beer busts, award ceremonies, and other forms of hoopla. These methods work because they are all ways of giving positive attention to people, releasing their pride, competitive spirit, sense of community feeling, and willingness to meet challenges. The forms and techniques may differ from company to company, but the principle remains the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">However, these external forms of attention still belong to the lesser of the greater powers. There are inherent limits to their effectiveness. They tend to become routine, habitual, empty, and flat after a while, like the parting smile of a tired flight attendant who has already said good-bye to a hundred passengers who left the plane before you did.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These methods are successful only so long as and to the extent that they express a real interest, concern, and commitment on the part of management for its employees. When management genuinely feels this way, the form of attention given is less important, or rather, any form will do. It need not even be planned. In fact, the spontaneous expression of attention in the course of work has a greater significance, because it is unexpected and more natural. When management has the right motives and feelings in its relations with employees, employees change their attitude. Their submissiveness changes into loyalty, obedience turns into cooperation, and reluctant or resigned acceptance is converted into enthusiastic agreement. Employees come to identify with the company&rsquo;s beliefs, values, and goals. Work becomes expansive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Sears&rsquo; System</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Freedom and responsibility are greater incentives than money. When General Robert Wood moved Sears into retail stores in the 1920s, he built up a decentralized, loose-knit retail system that extended a great deal of freedom to store managers and demanded a large measure of self-reliance and personal capacity from them. As James Worthy described the system in </span><span class="c2">Shaping an American Institution</span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">People were encouraged, even pushed, to reach to the limit of their capabilities, and sometimes to develop capabilities they never knew they had.&hellip; It was built around dynamic forces which fostered the processes of growth and maturation. It left ample room for growth to occur within the individual, recognizing that while growth could be encouraged or inhibited by external conditions, it was the individual who had to do the growing.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt82" id="ftnt_ref82">[82]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Wood&rsquo;s system is still in force today. Entrepreneurship in Sears&rsquo; 798 retail stores is encouraged not only at the level of the general manager but all the way down. The Wayne, New Jersey, store is divided into 15 divisions, each headed by a separate manager. Each division maintains its own profit-and-loss accounts. The divisional managers are given greater freedom and responsibility than many store managers running other retail shops. The store manager, Bill Collett, explains:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">By responsibility, I mean the magnitude of the job, the ability to merchandise, to schedule our people, to set up and control inventories&mdash;it&rsquo;s far beyond what most retailers give their employees. Our people have more involvement.&hellip; he autonomy that you have is one of the areas that is most exciting. The company gives you freedom. There are parameters, obviously, that you have to stay within, but within that you do have a broad range of decision making. I don&rsquo;t look over the managers&rsquo; shoulders and breathe down their necks. I explain what I want from them and give them enough rope to do their jobs. I think people respond very positively to it. I know that I do myself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Psychological Incentives</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most powerful incentives for motivating people are neither the lure of material rewards for high performance nor recognition and approval for surpassing one&rsquo;s peers. The greatest potentials of organization are revealed when the psychological energies of the individuals are released in pursuit of their own personal growth. When people grow through their work, they require no material incentives or social recognition. Their work becomes self-rewarding, self-motivating, and filled with joy. Employees at Delta derive a sense of personal satisfaction from making the customer happy. Delta flight attendant Chris Hendrix said: &quot;We don&rsquo;t smile at the passengers because we feel we have to do it for the company. We do it because the company is there for us. We want to do it for the company. I&rsquo;m proud of this company. This company has done a lot for me, personally.&quot; When an organization provides individuals with opportunities of this type, it becomes a living organization.</span></p><p class="c4 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">The Living Organization</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What makes an organization come alive? Let us start with the individual. When does an individual become interested, vivacious, overflowing with energy? Recollect the most exciting moments in your own life, and the answer will be clear. When the outer circumstances or activities of our life appeal to our own inner seeking, we become actively involved and enthusiastic. When our work becomes an avenue or occasion for personal growth, we feel energetic and take joy in what we do.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People have two ways of existence&mdash;surviving and growing. When they are just surviving, life is routine, habitual, dull, flat, boring. The only satisfaction comes from physical pleasures and comfort. When they are growing, life becomes fresh, exciting, challenging, thrilling, and enjoyable. The child grows physically for 18 years or so, but people can continue to grow in knowledge, maturity, life experience, emotions, and skills throughout their whole life. Surviving requires a minimum of energy; growth requires a maximum. During times of growth our physical, nervous, and mental energies are at their peak, flowing and overflowing on all sides. When our inner motives or outer circumstances release our maximum energies, we grow psychologically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When an organization genuinely commits itself to the personal growth of its people, it can help create the right inner motives and external conditions for their development. When the company grows, the people grow with it. When the people grow, the company grows, too. Each can stimulate the other. The individuals come to identify their personal seeking more and more with the company&rsquo;s progress and find personal fulfillment by giving themselves to it through service. When this happens, the psychological energies of the individual are constantly being released in work and flowing out to animate the life of the organization. The organization becomes alive and charged with a vivifying energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c41">Ten Steps for Establishing Positive Authority</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A natural, progressive development of authority takes place in organizations: personal enforcement of discipline by the proprietor or founder; impersonal discipline enforced through rules and systems; self-discipline by employees and peer pressure based on an attitude of loyalty and commitment to the success of the organization; and finally, self-motivating and self-rewarding dedication by each individual worker in an atmosphere of freedom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The stages of this progression can be reduced to ten basic steps:</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">1.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Decision</span><span class="c3">: Decide which areas and values of the company are absolutely vital to its very existence.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">2.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Standards</span><span class="c3">: Establish clear and precise lines of authority, decision-making powers, and guidelines for behavior in these core areas.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">3.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Regulations</span><span class="c3">: Develop well-defined rules and regulaltions for enforcement of proper conduct in the core areas.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">4.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Systems</span><span class="c3">: Create systems to monitor and evaluate performance and to enforce discipline in the core areas wherever necessary.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">5.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Training</span><span class="c3">: Educate new recruits and present employees to fully understand and appreciate the importance of conforming to the standards.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">6.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Communication</span><span class="c3">: Constantly re-emphasize the importance of these standards through various forms of communication and by example.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">7.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Reward</span><span class="c3">: Introduce incentives for outstanding performance by individuals or groups with respect to core values.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">8. </span><span class="c2">Recognition and award</span><span class="c3">: Offer personal recognition either publicly or privately to those who perform exceptionally well.</span></p><p class="c4 c13"><span class="c3">9.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Corporate milieu</span><span class="c3">: When the values are fully accepted and adhered to without the need for rigorous systems and strict discipline, relax the external forms of enforcement, extend greater freedom, and gradually allow self-discipline and peer pressure to take the place of external authority.</span></p><p class="c4 c13" id="h.cideerm9a929"><span class="c3">10.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Identification</span><span class="c3">: In each individual try to build up a personal understanding of, commitment to, and identification with these values, so that the person&rsquo;s adherence to them becomes an expression of his or her own personal growth and a self-rewarding experience.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 5 - System, System, System!</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the fall of 1542 Humayun, the second Mogul emperor of India, was on a military campaign, while his wife lay in bed at home expecting the birth of their first child. Humayun longed for a son to inherit and expand his empire, and he was anxious to receive news of the child&#39;s birth the moment it occurred. So he called all the ministers of the court to advise him on how the news could be sent from the city where the empress lay to his camp 100 miles away in the shortest possible time. One minister suggested sending word by the emperor&#39;s best rider on his fastest horse. But over rough terrain in the scorching heat, a journey of 100 miles would take an entire day or more. Another minister improved on this idea by suggesting a relay of horses, with each rider traveling at top speed for 5 or 10 miles and passing on the message to the next one. The emperor was not satisfied with these suggestions. The ministers were stumped.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Finally a wise old minister announced, to the amazement of the assembly, that he had found a solution and would arrange for the message to travel faster than the fastest horse, faster even than the wind. The emperor was intrigued by the minister&#39;s boast and ordered him to execute it. The minister issued instructions for tall towers to be erected every few miles between the city and the emperor&#39;s camp. On top of each tower, someone was stationed with a drum. As soon as the child was born, a drum message was relayed across the 100-mile span in less than five minutes, announcing the birth of a son, who later became known as Akbar, the greatest of all the Mogul emperors of India. A simple system made possible a feat that seemed unimaginable at the time. That is the power of a system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Talk about systems has become so very commonplace that there hardly seems any point in discussing them further. But though the word has been severely overworked, systems themselves still remain a vastly underutilized resource. Almost everyone who wears eyeglasses has, on at least one occasion, looked everywhere for the glasses, only to discover he or she was wearing them. Our search for the secrets of the living organization is not very different. As a rule, people never understand the value of the things they enjoy. Systems are no exception. They are so pervasive, fundamental, and essential to the routine workings of business and society that we take them completely for granted&mdash;unless, of course, they break down.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Corporate Impersonality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Let us begin with a definition and description of what systems are all about. Individual acts are the basic units of any work. Several acts occurring in succession for a particular purpose constitute an activity. In an organization there are many activities like recruitment, purchasing, sales, planning, accounting, shipping goods, receiving customers, and distribution of mail that are repeated over and over again in the same way. Every type of repetitive activity can be reduced to a system. A system is an arrangement of acts or activities into a standardized, fixed sequence consisting of a series of step-by-step procedures. Systems link activities in an orderly manner to ensure greater efficiency and a smoother flow of work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Earlier we likened systems to the temperamental traits of an individual&#39;s personality. Each person has certain characteristic and predictable ways of behaving that tend to recur under particular circumstances. So do corporations. Systems are an organization&#39;s fixed patterns of response to recurring situations. When a handbag is lost or a child is separated from his or her parents at Disneyland, there is a system to handle the problem and set it right with a smile. When an employee at Eastman Kodak Company has an innovative idea, there is a system for receiving, evaluating, and rewarding the suggestion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Systems are like the nerve channels of a corporation. When we accidentally place our hand on a very hot object, the hand is quickly withdrawn by an automatic nervous response, which does not require or await a conscious decision on our part. Companies have similar automatic or habitual responses to most types of recurring situations. When orders come in, they are automatically processed without requiring fresh instructions each time from the CEO. When stocks are depleted, they are automatically reordered. When sales are made, they are immediately recorded and reported to the accounting department on a regular basis. When products are manufactured, they are routinely subjected to rigorous quality-control checks. All these routine, habitual expressions of corporate behavior are made possible by systems.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Modern commercial organizations are distinguished from those of earlier times primarily by the presence of sophisticated, impersonal systems to replace functioning through personal management. This has enabled these organizations to grow to a much larger size, to function over longer distances, and to maintain greater uniformity and coordination than could ever be attained otherwise. All systems, regardless of their purpose, share several common attributes:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. A system is a mechanism that completes a full cycle of activity. It is not uncommon to find &quot;fragments&quot; of systems operative in modern organizations, such as inventory records that are never examined to analyze discrepancies and errors, or personnel evaluation forms that are never utilized to improve performance or distribute rewards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. A system can function effectively only when it is based on a set of accepted standards and clear policy directives to handle exceptions. A mechanism that works most of the time but is often circumvented is a habit, not a system. The fixing of salaries is not governed by a system if the decision is made by different people at different times following different guidelines.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. Systems make possible evaluation of individual or group performance against an established standard, thereby providing a work incentive for the individual and a means of monitoring and control by management. Without this element of evaluation, no system is complete.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. Systems constitute the central nervous system of an organization. They must be fully integrated with each other and supported by subsystems that extend into all &quot;limbs&quot; of the organization&#39;s functioning. The health of the organization as a whole can be assessed by monitoring the performance of its peripheral subsystems. It is in the execution of small, routine matters that organizational efficiency is most easily measured.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. Systems are creative in the sense that they make creativity possible. When appropriate systems are introduced or existing ones are perfected, the organization is able to convert underutilized and untapped resources into new growth and expansion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People constitute the personal side of organizational life. Systems constitute the impersonal dimension of a company. Creativity, expansiveness, enthusiasm, inspiration, leadership, and human satisfaction are expressions of the personal side. Organization, productivity, order, efficiency, harmony, consistency, and stability are expressions of the impersonal side. This impersonality is embodied in the rules, procedures, and systems that an organization adopts for its functioning.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Thinking Manager&#39;s Capital</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the turn of the century, 60 percent of the American people lived in rural areas, many of them isolated by vast distances from life in the cities, where retail merchandising was almost exclusively concentrated. With mechanization, the farming community was becoming more productive and more prosperous, yet farmers still depended almost exclusively on traveling sales reps and ill-provisioned general stores to meet their growing appetite for modern conveniences and luxuries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Julius Rosenwald saw the growing opportunities of the rural market. When he joined Richard Sears, he brought to their enterprise an inspiring mission and new values. The mission he conceived was to become a buyer for the American farmer, to sell a broad selection of products that the rural community could not readily obtain through existing sources&mdash;clothing, dry goods, patent medicines, bicycles, musical instruments, hunting equipment, kitchenware, tools, and so on. The new values he contributed were embodied in the policy &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back.&quot; With these basic elements as a psychic center, Sears, Rosenwald, and later Otto Doering created an organization to carry out this mission. The psychic center gave direction to their enterprise, and the organization gave it form; but in order to put their inspiring ideas and prodigious talents into practice, they required one more thing&mdash;a system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Although 45 million Americans were residing out in the country-side at the time, 90 percent of them lived in areas with populations of fewer than 100 people. The average density of the rural population was so low that establishing retail stores to serve even half of this community would have required a prohibitive investment and yielded extremely poor returns. An alternative system was required and was already in existence&mdash;the mail-order catalog. In 1872 Montgomery Ward had established a catalog to serve the needs of the rural community, and it had grown to include some 10,000 items.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Rosenwald adopted the mail-order system and the money-back guarantee from Montgomery Ward, but he upgraded the system to reflect his own business values. By insisting on very high ethical standards in advertising and a consistently higher quality of merchandise, he in effect created the first factual mail-order catalog, the &quot;wish book.&quot; The combination of these values and the talents of the two proprietors enabled them to surpass the performance of Montgomery Ward &amp; Company within the first five years, using the very system that Ward had developed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Systems are the channels through which organizations translate their ideas into actions. What a large investment of capital in retail stores could never have achieved, a system could. Systems are the thinking manager&#39;s capital. As the mail-order system enabled Sears to sell its products to an inaccessible rural market, the drive-in restaurant and the in-flight catering service enabled Marriott to sell food to mobile American travelers. In each case, a new system spanned the gap between a business and its customers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Golden Gap</span></p><a id="id.ol91cjhc29b0"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The catalog-sales system was so successful that it brought more orders than either Sears or Rosenwald ever dreamed of&mdash;and more problems, too. The sheer volume of new orders pouring in threatened to drown the young business in a sea of paper. As one executive described it: &quot;The whole operation became chaotic. Long delays in shipments, a rising tide of errors leading to a flood of returned goods which in turn were badly handled, absenteeism, replacement of `quitting&#39; employees by inexperienced people&mdash;all were combining to make the place a shambles.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt83" id="ftnt_ref83">[83]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Otto Doering joined the company in 1903, just in time to save the system by introducing another one&mdash;the schedule system. Doering designed and commissioned the Chicago mail-order factory, the first modern mass-production plant, covering an area of over 3 million square feet of floor space and equipped with moving conveyor belts, an assembly line, pneumatic tubes, elevators, and miles of railroad tracks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The plant actually derived its enormous efficiency from the co-ordination of two systems: a supply system to handle the purchase, delivery, and storage of tens of thousands of items of merchandise from hundreds of vendors, and a delivery system to handle the processing and dispatch of tens of thousands of customer orders a day. The huge volume of incoming goods had to be sorted out, stocked, and matched with the orders on hand. The quantities of merchandise and paperwork were far beyond anything attempted before. Proper execution demanded strict discipline and precise timing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the gap between two related activities is bridged by linking and coordinating two separate systems, an enormous creative potential is unleashed. Doering&#39;s invention was so effective that &quot;a company which had been on the verge of having to halt its growth suddenly found itself with a virtually unlimited capacity for continued expansion.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt84" id="ftnt_ref84">[84]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The system enabled the company&#39;s catalog sales to grow from $50 million in 1907, the first full year of its operation, to $235 million in 1920; and they have multiplied another 20-fold since then, to around $5 billion a year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Systems are not only the basic building blocks of an organization. They are also the bridges and bonds it uses to connect and bind its various parts into a single whole. There is gold buried in the invisible zone between two uncoordinated systems. How many such gaps are there in every company? There are as many gaps as there are systems&mdash;gaps between design, production, distribution, sales, marketing, purchasing, research, accounting, recruiting, training, planning, and countless other systematic functions of a company. Every one of them possesses a rich vein of unmined ore. Sears&#39; example is impressive because its size is impressive. But the principle is equally true of the smallest retail store, corner restaurant, and garage-scale manufacturing firm, thousands of which are multiplying this very moment at much greater rates than Sears ever did, without fully understanding the reason for their own growth.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Systems Magic</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Sears entered the retail store business, its mission was broadened to encompass all American households as its customer base. New systems were required to serve this wider mission. One of the most productive of these has been the Sears credit card.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The aim of most credit-card systems is to attract the higher-middle-income and upper-income families, who buy more and can afford to pay for what they buy. Since Sears&#39; mission is to serve as many American households as possible, the aim of the system is to extend credit to the maximum number of families, including those in the lower income groups, but at the same time to keep its losses from nonpayment as low as possible. These two objectives are in direct conflict with each other, yet Sears has successfully reconciled them through a system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Today Sears&#39; credit card is the most widely held in the world. Approximately 40 million American families hold a Sears card. Sears receives roughly 10 million new credit applications every year and approves 4 million of them. The volume alone requires a fairly remarkable system. Sears provides credit to more households with incomes above $30,000 than does the American Express Company and more credit to lower-income households, too&mdash;about 14 percent of all households in low-income urban areas. More remarkable yet, Sears&#39; losses from nonpayment amount to only 1 percent of credit sales, which is less than all the major bank credit cards and less than half the level of Sears&#39; major competitors. Unbelievable as it may seem, Sears does not even have a minimum income standard for approval of credit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How does Sears do it? That is the magic of a system. Over many years of experience, the company has developed a very sophisticated credit-approval system, which consists of 700 models, a different model for almost every geographic region in which it sells. By carefully refining the system, the company has identified the characteristics of creditworthy customers at different levels of income and in different parts of the country. The system enables it to extend more credit&mdash;$12 billion worth&mdash;to more households than any other credit-card system. Largely because of this system, Americans buy 40 percent of all washers and dryers, 40 percent of automobile replacement batteries, and an incredible 75 percent of all bench power tools from Sears. A system makes it possible for the company to achieve its mission as supplier to the mass American market.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Technology of Organization</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A common misconception of small entrepreneurial companies is the belief that today&#39;s giant corporations achieved their present status on the strength of some unique personal endowments of their founders, a brilliant idea or new technology, or a large reserve of capital it tapped for investment. In most cases, the only unique endowment of the founder was a willingness to work hard; the only brilliant idea was a commitment to quality or service; the only new technology was a knowledge of how to motivate people; and the only reserve the firm tapped was one of the many powers of organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In assessing the productive strength of a corporation, we naturally focus our attention on its financial, technical, and human resources&mdash;assets, cash flow, product quality, managerial abilities, technical skills, proven capacity for innovation, market position, and so on. In so doing, we tend to overlook the enormous productive power of other organizational resources. It is well known in industry that a good technology is as important to success as capital and can sometimes achieve what money alone never can. Many a poor inventor has died extremely rich. It is less commonly recognized that inventing the right system can be even more profitable than inventing the right product. As technology is the engineer&#39;s capital, systems are the businessperson&#39;s technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Whatever a company&#39;s financial or technological resources may be, systems possess the power to increase their productivity thousands of times. When Ford was founded in 1903, the American automobile industry consisted of several hundred small-scale assembly units, each manufacturing a few hundred or a few thousand cars a year. The cars ranged in price from $1,000 to $2,000, placing them beyond the reach of the vast majority of Americans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Henry Ford was one among the many. His company sold 1,745 cars in its first year of operation at a little less than $1,000 each and increased the number to 9,000 in 1906. But his dream was to produce an affordable car for the masses. The two major constraints were the slow speed of existing production techniques and the high costs involved in the process. He overcame both with a system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Five years after Doering commissioned the Chicago mail-order plant, Ford&#39;s new Highland Park factory for mass production of the Model T came into full use. There was nothing new or original about the plant, except that the proven system of a moving assembly line was employed for the first time to manufacture automobiles.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ford&#39;s gigantic &quot;Crystal Palace,&quot; covering some 50,000 square feet, consisted of three main assembly lines supported by an endless number of conveyors, chutes, tubes, bins, and hoists supplying components to fixed work positions along the lines in a steady stream to ensure non-stop production. These physical systems were supported by a host of administrative systems for inventory control, job routing, purchasing, shipping, and accounting. After visiting the plant, a reporter from the </span><span class="c2">Detroit Journal</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;described the operation in three words: &quot;System, System, System!&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt85" id="ftnt_ref85">[85]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ford&#39;s systems reduced the work required for assembling a chassis from 728 minutes of one worker&#39;s time to 93 minutes and brought down the price of the Model T from $950 to $290, well within the reach of the common person. From 1906 to 1916 the company&#39;s car production increased 80-fold. Between 1908 and 1927 over 15 million Model Ts were built by these systems. During World War II, Ford employed a similar integrated production system at its Willow Run plant to produce new B-24 bombers at the rate of one an hour.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These systems not only produced cars, they produced capital, too&mdash;lots of it. In 1903 Ford started with a cash base of $28,000. By 1913, without any subsequent investment, the company had accumulated assets valued at more than $22.5 million and had paid out $15 million in dividends. By 1927 the company&#39;s cash surplus alone was nearly $700 million&mdash;a 25,000-fold increase in 24 years!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ford applied a known organizational technology to a new field with phenomenal results. The introduction of these systems transformed the industry from a group of a few hundred small-scale units into a handful of large-scale manufacturers. In the process, he demonstrated once and for all the incredible productive power of coordinated systems.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Distant Traveler</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">While many companies are alive to the potential for applying proven technologies such as the computer to new fields, how many see the far greater potential for applying proven systems to new fields as Ford has done? One example of a system that has been going places is the one developed by Coca-Cola for distribution of its soft drinks.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Until 1899 Coke was sold only through soda fountains. In that year two men from Chattanooga attending a baseball game came across a soft drink that was sold in a bottle. They approached Asa Candler, who owned Coca-Cola at the time, to suggest that he sell Coke in bottles. Candler was not interested but agreed to give the two men a perpetual franchise to sell bottled Coke throughout practically the whole United States. The franchise was awarded for $1. Legend has it that even that dollar was never paid. If so, it was the best dollar Coca-Cola never made&mdash;&quot;a master-stroke&quot; as </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;called it.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt86" id="ftnt_ref86">[86]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;For this was the beginning of the company&#39;s franchise bottling system&mdash;the granddaddy of franchising&mdash;consisting of independent bottlers, whose entrepreneurial spirit has carried Coke to the four corners of the world. Today the system includes 1,500 bottling companies in 155 countries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Just as people respond to personal attention by performing better, so do systems. In recent years Coca-Cola has been giving a lot of attention to its franchise bottling system to raise its performance to the highest possible level. Many of the bottlers had become so successful and so wealthy that they felt little incentive to expand further. In 1979 Coca-Cola began a major program to upgrade the system by bringing in a new generation of entrepreneurs who are raring to grow and willing to invest. Since then more than 120 franchises covering over 50 percent of Coca-Cola&#39;s business in the United States have changed hands in transactions valued at more than $2 billion. Coca-Cola&#39;s attention to the system paid off. Between 1979 and 1983 the company&#39;s operating revenues grew by 50 percent, and its share of the U.S. soft drink market exceeded 38 percent. As the president of one large independent Coca-Cola bottling company described the systems update: &quot;Coca-Cola USA has energized the system.&hellip;The sleeping giant is wide awake.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt87" id="ftnt_ref87">[87]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Following its acquisition of Columbia Pictures in 1982, Coca-Cola is in the process of taking its franchise system into an entirely new field&mdash;entertainment. It has begun test distribution of movies on videocassettes through the bottling companies to retail stores. Whatever the outcome, it demonstrates the tremendous potential for adapting systems for new applications.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A System Diversifies</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The franchise system adopted by Coca-Cola in 1899 has formed the basis for many entirely new industries. In 1955, at age 66, Colonel Harland Sanders founded the business for which he has become famous. At the time the only things he had going for him were a good idea, a great system, and a $105 Social Security check. The idea and the system long outlasted the check. His idea was a recipe for frying chicken in a special high-temperature cooker. His system was to sell franchises to restaurants&mdash;leasing them the cookers, supplying napkins and buckets carrying the Kentucky Fried Chicken name along with his image, and charging $0.05 for every chicken the restaurants sold. By 1964 Colonel Sanders had granted more than 500 franchises and sold the business for $2 million. Today there are over 6,000 units in 54 countries with total sales of more than $2 billion. That is the productive power of a system!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The fast-food business actually began way back in 1921, when White Castle opened its first hamburger stand. The company had the right idea, but not the system. White Castle never sold a franchise. Sixty years later it still had only 175 units. If it had not been for the franchise system, there might only be 175 McDonald&#39;s restaurants today, too, instead of 7,500. Ray Kroc, the founder of the McDonald&#39;s Corporation, opened his first McDonald&#39;s franchise in 1955, and within five years he surpassed the level reached by White Castle over the period of a half-century. By 1982 there were McDonald&#39;s franchises all over the world, with sales of $7.8 billion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The power of the franchise system results from combining the entrepreneurial initiative of private owners with the name, expertise, and experience of the parent company. Franchising is a system that is transforming the way retail business is done in the United States. Today there are nearly half a million franchise outlets selling goods and services for around $500 billion a year, which represents more than a third of the nation&#39;s total retail sales. The system has accommodated itself to an incredible variety of businesses, including franchise mail and package delivery, film sales and processing, dry cleaning, printing, photocopying, health clubs, home security, computers, and home renovation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How many hundreds or thousands of systems are now being employed in other companies and other industries that could be adopted or upgraded to enrich the life of any organization? Adopting a system that is already prevalent in the field enables a company to compete with the leaders of the industry. Adapting a system to a new field enables a company to become leader of the industry.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Values of Systems</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bill Marriott, Sr., and Tomas Bata utilized systems for more effective implementation of corporate values. Values can also be utilized to give greater effective force to systems. There is virtually an infinite scope for increasing the power of systems by a commitment to higher values in their implementation. This is what Julius Rosenwald did when he insisted on honesty and reliability in the operation of Sears&#39; mail-order system. Merck enhanced the effectiveness of its marketing system by insisting on truthfulness with the medical community. Du Pont increased the efficiency of its operating systems by striving hard to protect its workers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The Federal Express Corporation created a new business out of an old system based on two values: reliability and punctuality. Recognizing the tremendous importance that Americans place on time, Frederick Smith devised a system to save it. He adopted the basic elements of the system from the U.S. Postal Service and United Parcel Service, Inc.&mdash;a squadron of airplanes and a fleet of delivery vans&mdash;but brought down delivery times for a parcel from three days or more to less than 24 hours. The idea itself was not new, but the quality and reliability of service were&mdash;99 percent of packages delivered on time. Virtually overnight, Federal Express has grown into a $1.4 billion company, and the overnight-delivery business as a whole has exploded into a $5 billion industry.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is an unlimited scope for upgrading the values of systems&mdash;quality, cleanliness, punctuality, reliability, friendliness of service, safety, job satisfaction, efficiency, productivity, and integrity&mdash;whether they are systems for serving a customer, serving food in an employee cafeteria, monitoring travel expenses or individual job performance, or delivering goods and services on time or at the lowest possible cost.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Productive Marriage</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the case of Sears, we saw that the proper combination of two personalities or two systems generates a much greater power than the sum of the parts when they operate in isolation. The same golden gap exists for every organizational resource (such as skills, capital, technology, or machinery) and for every combination of two different resources (such as capital and technology or skills and machinery). Each enhances and multiplies the effectiveness of the other. This potential also exists when any other resource is combined with a system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One of the most obvious present-day examples of this principle is the impact of computer technology on business systems. The marriage of systems with computers has increased the productive powers of the organization many times. Yet most companies have only just begun to explore the enormous opportunities in this area.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What would you do if you had 50,000 cars that you were trying to rent to the public from 1,000 locations around the United States and your highest priority was good customer service, which means always having a car available to the customer when he or she has reserved one? Most companies would probably go out of business. The fact that Hertz has twice that many cars, a reputation for reliable service, and a profitable business as well is primarily due to a computerized management system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It all sounds so logical that it is easy to assume things were always this way, but they were not. When the rent-a-car business began to take off in the 1960s, computers were being used by companies almost exclusively for standard accounting purposes. Hertz and the other rent-a-car firms kept track of the supply and demand for their cars around the country on manual worksheets. In the mid-1970s Hertz introduced one of the first computer-based decision-support systems used in business.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The supply and demand for cars is influenced by such factors as day of the week, season of the year, special events, conventions, transfer of cars from other locations, impact of weather on incoming flights, and availability of cars from competitor companies. The new system takes into account these variables and enables each city manager to project the demand and availability of cars at each location on an hour-to-hour basis with 95 percent to 98 percent accuracy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">After introduction of the system, there has been a 10 percent improvement in the utilization of Hertz&#39;s fleet of cars, which represents a saving for the company of between $25 million and $40 million a year. More important, the system has enabled the company to double its size, which would have been extremely difficult under the old manual system. The quality of customer service is also significantly better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Five years ago the operating system was integrated into an overall business planning system that enables managers to quickly evaluate the impact of any major decision concerning things like pricing, level of investment, or expenditure on advertising on overall performance and profitability. The rent-a-car business has become so competitive and complex and the margins of profit so marginal that, according to Vice-President Marty Edelstein, without the system &quot;we probably couldn&#39;t even run the business.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are countless other types of systems, both simple and sophisticated, that can be linked to the computer with similar results. The increased productivity arising from linking systems to a higher order of technology can be obtained by linking systems with other organizational resources as well. The introduction of higher-order skills, for instance, can raise the efficiency of a system manyfold. The opportunities are all around us.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Too Much or Too Little?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Despite the widely shared impression that American business is organized to the core and is suffering from an overdose of bureaucracy, even the best of American companies tap only 50 percent or 60 percent efficiency from their systems. On August 5, 1984, </span><span class="c9 c11">The New York Times</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;carried an article reporting an unusual event that occurred a few months prior to the breakup of the Bell System:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">The American Telephone and Telegraph Company dispatched a cadre of white-collar soldiers to its warehouses to find out why shipments of small office switchboards were running behind schedule. At one Manhatten warehouse, a group of crates that had sat ignored for no one knew how long turned out to contain 200 of the phone switchboards for which customers had been clamoring.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The </span><span class="c9 c11">Times</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;article goes on to quote a former AT&amp;T salesman:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c9">Here&#39;s the largest company in the world, a company that&#39;s supposed to be so sophisticated and computerized, opening boxes to find out what it had in inventory.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt88" id="ftnt_ref88">[88]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The purchasing department of another large telephone-equipment manufacturer called up one of its suppliers urgently requesting a particular component to meet a production run in one of its plants. Since the supplier did not have the item in stock, it scanned its files to see if any other customer might have some extra pieces available. After a while it called back the manufacturer to report it had located a very large stock of the component just a few miles away&mdash;at another plant belonging to the same manufacturer! How is it that the purchasing department had no record of the extra inventory? It happened because each of the plants has its own inventory coding system for components, and the code numbers used by the two plants for the item were different. According to Ed Devine, who has managed the American Management Association&#39;s Purchasing Division for many years, such incidents are quite common, and the larger the company, the more common they are.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Iacocca joined Chrysler, he discovered to his &quot;horror&quot; that there was no overall system for financial control or effective financial planning and projecting. Some of the bankers who reluctantly agreed to go along with the U.S. government&#39;s loan guarantees for Chrysler were not much better. One bank in Minnesota had a filing system that was so effective that Chrysler&#39;s loan agreements were put through the shredder by a cleaning lady before they could be signed. Another bank in Alaska had a dispatch system that was so well perfected that loan agreements required in Detroit to meet a government deadline were put in the postal system instead of being returned by express courier.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Until recently the accounts payable section of one of America&#39;s five largest insurance companies was run very efficiently by two women. The filing system they employed was excellent, except that no one but the two women could figure out how to use it. It is fortunate that the system was changed, because just two weeks later, the two women were involved in a traffic accident and hospitalized.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Are these examples all rare flukes or exceptions to the American rule? It is more likely that they represent standard operating procedure in many companies. Every company, even the most excellent, has dozens of experiences like these that it wishes had never happened but that always do because systems do not receive the constant and continuous attention they deserve. &quot;Systems?&quot; says the executive. &quot;We&#39;ve got all we need.&quot; The real issue is not how many systems a company has, but how well and appropriately it uses them. Systems do some things very well and other things quite poorly. Systems stimulate growth in some areas and prevent it in others. Systems are merely an instrument. They function productively only when guided by the right psychic direction and controlled by a strong corporate character.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Systems Review</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Almost every problem can be solved in more than one way. A cashflow problem, for instance, can be resolved by obtaining a loan, firing staff, or selling assets. It can also be solved by an organizational innovation that raises productivity, speeds up deliveries, accelerates collection of receivables, or attracts additional business by improving the quality of a product or service. All the other solutions cost money. The organizational solution may cost nothing. Perhaps that is why it is often neglected or underestimated. Imitation of another country, like Japan, even when possible, is difficult. Why go to the trouble when there are hundreds of organizational innovations that we can make based on our own cultural heritage that will yield equal or greater results?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Have you ever noticed the impact that a small improvement in a system can make on efficiency, quality, speed, or ease of functioning? Much time and money can be saved, much irritation and confusion can be eliminated by making simple refinements in the systems we use. It has become standard practice in many companies to periodically or continuously review long-term goals, short-term objectives, plans, budget allocations, job performance, salary scales, and many other aspects of their business in order to assess the adequacy of their functioning. Adjustments are then made because of changes within the company or in its external environment. Systems are one organizational resource that is not frequently subjected to close scrutiny and review in order to update them or improve their performance. Yet the benefits that can result from regular reviews of all systems are quite substantial. Otto Doering recognized this and set up a methods department in 1906 to continuously refine and improve systems at Sears&#39; mail-order plant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Merck regularly reviews its system for introduction of new products to shorten the period required for research, development, clinical testing, FDA approval, training, and marketing. Every day&#39;s delay in getting a new product on the market represents not only a lost sale but also a shorter period before the expiry of patent rights on the drug or the development of a better one by competitors. For this reason, Eugene McCabe, vice-president of marketing at MSD, says, &quot;We are constantly changing that system and constantly modifying and upgrading and improving it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The policy-owners&#39; services department of Northwestern Mutual is continuously reviewing its procedures for receiving and replying to customer inquiries. In 1969 a major systems update was undertaken, which brought down the time required to open a new insurance service account from six days to one. The ratio of policy-owner letters answered within five days rose from 11 percent in 1969 to 80 percent in 1970.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt89" id="ftnt_ref89">[89]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Although there is a lot of research involved in responding to inquiries from customers about their policies, Northwestern Mutual is still not satisfied with its system and is continuously trying to improve it. Where payments are involved, the response time has been reduced to two days; for transactions, three days; and for all other correspondence the goal is to respond within six days. Three times a week the service representatives report their oldest pending case, and twice a month an accurate measurement is made of their response time. The representatives themselves are constantly suggesting ways to improve the system. In the new business department the face amount of new policies issued has increased by 50 percent over the last two years, but staff has increased by only 7 percent. Systems reviews are one of the reasons why Northwestern Mutual has the highest productivity in its industry. The company&#39;s operating expenses are 20 percent to 30 percent lower than those of its competitors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every company has recurring types of problems that crop up now and then under certain circumstances. These problems become characteristic traits of the company, just as its systems are. But at Coca-Cola, every time a problem arises, the firm not only tries to solve it, but also tries to remove its cause at the source. Coca-Cola&#39;s senior vice-president for finance remarked that confidence in the proper working of its systems is very important to the company. &quot;We spend a lot of time when something doesn&#39;t go right, not so much to analyze the mistake but to analyze the systematic failure that caused the mistake. I&#39;m liable to call six people together and say: `OK, we are all part of a system. Where didn&#39;t the system work?&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">General Mills is continuously striving to improve its systems. In the Grocery Products Sales Division, constant modification of the sales representatives&#39; routing system has enabled the company to raise its sales volume by 60 percent without any increase in personnel. The Package Foods Operations Division encourages employees to suggest even minor improvements involving less than $1,000. It creates an atmosphere of participation and an urge for perfection, which has spawned a 10 percent increase in cases produced per worker-hour over the last two years, and productivity is still rising. Constant improvements in the distribution system have held costs per case to a 1 percent increase since 1979, despite a 15 percent increase in salaries. The quality of service has also improved, so that the company has moved up from No. 5 to No. 1 in customer surveys. At General Mills, systems reviews have become a regular activity. Gene Sailer, director of manufacturing, Package Foods Operations Division, says:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c9">We&#39;ve done a lot of looking at our organization. We&#39;re using outside resources to keep ourselves abreast. We&#39;re permitting employees to visit from one plant to another, so they can share ideas. To be successful in the long term, we have to </span><span class="c9 c11">institutionalize</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;these things. It&#39;s not a program. It&#39;s a process.&hellip;And we&#39;re still not where we want to be. It&#39;s a continuing effort to get better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Senior Vice-President and Technical Director John Luck says that in general a company can &quot;improve its operations up to 40 percent when threatened&mdash;we try to tap that resource </span><span class="c9 c11">before</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;being threatened.&quot; </span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt90" id="ftnt_ref90">[90]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Have you ever wondered why telephone operators are not quite so talkative as they used to be? The reason is very simple. From about 1970 until the breakup of AT&amp;T, the Bell System was continuously trying to improve the efficiency of its operator systems in order to keep phone rates down. Before 1970 the average time required by an operator to handle a single call was 60 seconds. By a combination of improved technology, better operator training, and constant monitoring, the average time was gradually brought down to 30 seconds, then 20, and finally 15.9. Today&#39;s operator handles nearly four calls per minute instead of one. Who ever said Ma Bell is getting old?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A periodic review of all systems can give fresh momentum to the activity of any department. Each system can be broken down into its step-by-step procedures and carefully analyzed. Then the links between systems can be studied to determine to what extent they are properly coordinated. Another proven technique is the one followed by Coca-Cola. List all problems and try to trace each one back to a defective system, or at least try to find a way to solve the problem by upgrading systems. This strategy focuses attention on the golden gaps in the existing fabric of interacting systems and highlights the points where the system itself or its coordination and integration with other systems are not adequate. As Herb Dean, a systems consultant and former director of office operations at Kodak, expressed it: &quot;You should review everything you are doing. Systems are really the key to success.&quot;</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Maximum Utilization of Systems</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Systems are an invaluable resource. Like other resources, they should be fully and properly utilized. Systems are the lifelines of an organization, and the organization&#39;s efficiency is measured by the effectiveness with which it utilizes them. The most successful companies are not only the most value-driven, innovative, and enthusiastic. They are also the best organized and most systematic. Every company can profit by asking itself five simple questions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">1. </span><span class="c9 c11">Are all our systems functioning properly</span><span class="c3">? If a system is occasionally inadequate to keep up with its workload or if it is sometimes necessary for a manager to interfere with a system to set things right or if unforeseen problems arise in routine areas of work, something is wrong with either the design of the system or the way in which it is being used.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">2. </span><span class="c9 c11">At the points of intersection between different systems, is there harmonious coordination and integration</span><span class="c3">? Managers spend a lot of time acting as informal and personal links between two or more systems that have not been properly joined. Most problems a manager is confronted with arise from systems that are poorly designed or inadequately coordinated. Both problems can be eliminated.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">3.</span><span class="c9 c11">&nbsp;Are we fully utilizing all the systems we have introduced</span><span class="c3">? Companies frequently introduce a system and then bypass it during normal operations. If a system is no good, change it or scrap it. Otherwise, use it without exception. Half-hearted implementation is a sign to the employees that management is not very serious about systematic functioning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">4. </span><span class="c9 c11">Are there any systems successfully employed by other companies that we could introduce here</span><span class="c3">? Of course there are&mdash;probably dozens. Imagine how long a company could compete in today&#39;s world if it refused to employ the latest technological developments introduced by its competitors. It wouldn&#39;t last very long. That is a quick recipe for technological obsolescence. A company that fails to introduce new systems that have proved successful elsewhere is heading for organizational obsolescence or worse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">5. </span><span class="c9 c11">Can we innovate any new systems that will further improve our performance</span><span class="c3">? When Hal Geneen took over as CEO of ITT in 1959, he devised a system to counteract the rigidity and compartmentalization common to large corporations. The system consisted of a team of head-quarters staff specialized in different fields, whose job it was to move throughout the company in search of new ideas and unresolved problems. The system created a supportive atmosphere for change and contributed to ITT&#39;s phenomenal growth through the 1960s.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Acid Test</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many companies pride themselves on the efficiency of their systems for low-cost production, effective marketing, and good customer service. But the truest measure of the extent to which a company effectively utilizes systems is not in these key areas where the company focuses the bulk of its energy and attention. The acid test of efficiency is the speed and manner in which the most insignificant, routine work is accomplished.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Filing</span><span class="c3">: How many executives feel lost the moment their secretary calls in sick, because they cannot find the papers they need in the filing cabinet? When files are arranged systematically, anyone who knows the system should be able to find any document with ease. This may frequently be the case for central files. But most company files maintained by individuals are kept as though they really were &quot;personal&quot; property and no one else&#39;s business. Trivial and unimportant, you say? There are presidents of multi-billion-dollar companies who squirm in embarrassment because their office cannot locate a letter or report sent to them. If that is the situation at the top of the organization, it should come as no surprise to learn that raw materials, products, and customer needs are misplaced or overlooked down the line. Filing papers promptly is also a difficult task for most companies. Every secretary seems to have a catchall drawer that never empties. Retrieving things quickly when they are needed is often even more difficult. When all individual files conform to a general filing system intelligible to every staff member, and when materials are filed promptly and are easily retrievable, the company passes a key test for systems utilization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Customer inquiries</span><span class="c3">: Many companies do not have a formal system for accurately determining where incoming calls should be routed. The caller gets bounced around until he or she is connected to the right party. Our personal experience with IBM indicates that it has a customer inquiry system capable of handling even unconventional inquiries smoothly and swiftly. The time required to reply to a routine letter is another index of systematic functioning. Many companies do not even have established standards for answering letters promptly. Some reply only to certain categories of letters. Those that answer all letters promptly are likely to be leaders in their field.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9 c11">Accounts</span><span class="c3">: A multinational company that sends out invoices 15 days after shipping orders may sound like an anachronism. So does one whose accounts are perpetually 30 days behind. Apart from the loss of interest due to delayed collection of receivables, these delays are symptoms of a deeper malady. Have you ever noticed that organizations that run into financial trouble inevitably have trouble keeping their accounts up to date, too? New York City in the 1970s was a classic example. It took months for the auditors to figure out what was really going on. Argentina, which reneged on its international financial obligations in 1984, was in a very similar position. The government did not know either how much money it had or how much it owed. Up-to-the-minute accounting systems may sound fairly easy, but they are extremely difficult to maintain&mdash;as difficult, perhaps, as enduring corporate success. Our feeling is that the two are very closely related achievements.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Test Your Systems</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is a simple technique that any manager can use to evaluate the efficiency of his or her department. Once a month, circulate a questionnaire to all department personnel to be filled in anonymously and returned. The questionnaire should contain items like the following:</span></p><ul class="c34 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c23 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">What is the oldest letter on your desk awaiting a reply? </span></li><li class="c58 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">How many telephone calls have been received but not yet replied to? </span></li><li class="c26 c58 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">How many files, books, and other articles have you finished using but not returned to their proper place? </span></li><li class="c58 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">How many minutes late have you been today reaching the office, attending meetings, returning from lunch, meeting deadlines, and so on? </span></li><li class="c58 c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">How many routine items of work like preparing a proposal, a plan, or a quotation are behind schedule or overdue at this moment? </span></li><li class="c26 c48 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">How many bills due for payment remain unpaid, and how many invoices are there for which collection is overdue? </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A constant improvement in results on the test over three to six months will be highly correlated with improvements in other objective measures of the department&#39;s performance, such as sales or productivity. </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">&nbsp;A Trusted Servant</span></p><a id="id.is37riqqztwr"></a><p class="c4" id="h.ena3ohp7kex1"><span class="c3">Systems are an essential component of the corporate personality. Through them the organization exercises its will to realize values and achieve goals. Without systems the corporate personality lacks a means of effective, coordinated self-expression. But however great their importance and their power, systems are at best only obedient subordinates, as illustrated in Figure 3 Their effectiveness depends on the direction set by the psychic center and the willpower of corporate character.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 334.00px; height: 329.00px;"><img alt="The role of systems in the corporate personality" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 334.00px; height: 329.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.gn5ntj7com84"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14">Figure 3: The role of systems in the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is ironic that the man who did the most to demonstrate the value of systems also demonstrated most graphically their limitations. In spite of Henry Ford&#39;s keen insight into the power of systems, he was blind to the greater power of which they form a part. He failed to understand that systems are only one component of the organization, and not the organization itself. During the 1930s he ran Ford in the same way he had when it was a tiny proprietary concern. He refused to delegate authority, develop managers, or permit anyone else to make decisions. Those executives who tried to manage either left the company or were fired.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.98bl7qoz2mpt"><span class="c9">Ford failed to discover the very first principle of organization&mdash;creation of an impersonal hierarchy and authority independent of the proprietor. As a result, the company&#39;s share of the automobile market, which had reached about 65 percent in the early 1920s, fell to 20 percent in the late 1930s. As Alfred Chandler, Jr., wrote, &quot;The incredibly bad management of his enormous industrial empire, which was so clearly reflected by the lack of any systematic organizational structure,&hellip;helped cause the rapid drop in Ford&#39;s profits and share of the market.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt91" id="ftnt_ref91">[91]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Half a century ago Alfred Sloan, the organization man, beat Henry Ford, the engineer.

It was a dark, cloudy day, and the country was in an equally sullen mood. Over 13 million workers had lost their jobs. More than 10,000 banks had failed in the last four years, and $5 billion had been lost. In the preceding month, 120 million people had rushed to the banks to withdraw their deposits before they, too, were lost. On March 3, in a single day, people had withdrawn more than $300 million from the system in a state of panic. It was clear that the nation&#39;s banking system was on the verge of collapse. This was the day on which Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated as the thirty-second president of the United States of America.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Roosevelt had a plan to save the banks. His strategy was so simple that it almost defies belief. He would appeal directly to the people. A day after assuming office, he declared a national banking holiday, and a week later he addressed the nation on radio in the first of his famous &quot;fireside chats.&quot; What did he say to the people? He explained in clear, simple language what the banking crisis was all about. It was a crisis of confidence, not of substance, and the root cause was fear. What did he tell these countless frightened millions, who had withdrawn billions of dollars from the banks? He told them there was nothing to fear, and he asked them to turn right around and return their hard-earned savings to the banks. And miracle of miracles, they did! When the banks reopened the next day, the lines of people waiting to withdraw their money did not form. The panic was stopped by a man&#39;s voice.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Politically, Roosevelt was in a strong position. He had an election mandate and the full support of Congress to back him up. But what he needed most was the confidence and cooperation of the people. He won them both with a brief radio address to the nation and a winning smile. Walter Lippmann wrote at the time, &quot;In one week the nation which had lost confidence in everything and everybody has regained confidence in the government and in itself.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt93" id="ftnt_ref93">[93]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most of the New Deal ideas were not actually new. Many had been aired before, some even tried by Hoover. Congress had supported Hoover, too, but he lacked the charm and spirit and homely way of speaking that FDR had perfected as an art. Roosevelt had a warm and vibrant personality, which inspired hope and trust, and he possessed consummate skill in communicating his ideas to the people. Without these two attributes&mdash;personality and skill&mdash;all his bright ideas, good intentions, and political backing could not have moved the people and saved the system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A proper blend of personality and skill is a key attribute of corporate success as well. Personality expresses the basic qualities of people&mdash;their values, character, and temperament. It tells us whether the basic material is a piece of quartz, a ruby, or a diamond. Skill expresses the degree to which the basic human material has been shaped, refined, and polished into a fine gem. Without skills, even the finest personality is an uncut stone, rich in content but poor in form. Without personality, skills are empty, lifeless gestures.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Recruiting a Whole Person</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In recruiting new employees, most companies focus on technical qualifications, educational background, and job experience. But very often the most critical factor is none of these. These are only the attributes of something more basic and more central&mdash;the person. Once Benjamin Franklin was looking for an editor to help run his newspaper. One man applied for the job, and Franklin invited him out to lunch. After lunch Franklin politely informed his guest that the job was not for him. The bewildered applicant asked why he had been rejected. Franklin replied that it was because the man salted his steak before tasting it. The job required an individual who would verify every fact before accepting it and never jump to a hasty conclusion. The man&#39;s action revealed that he was a creature of habit, who could act without prudence; therefore, he was not suited to be an editor. Franklin&#39;s technique may be a little too subtle and intuitive for most companies, but the incident does illustrate a point. Personality is important.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When we visited Delta for the first time, the taxi driver who drove us from the airport casually mentioned that he often brings over young women to be interviewed for flight attendants&#39; jobs with the company. He said: &quot;I can always tell in advance which ones they are going to hire. I know a Delta person when I see one.&quot; Intrigued by his remark, we eagerly asked: &quot;Who is a Delta person?&quot; He replied, &quot;She is a good person, wholesome&mdash;the kind of girl that any guy would be proud to bring home to meet his parents.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Thanks to the cabdriver, we were alerted to an interesting phenomenon. Wherever we went, we began to inquire more seriously about the type of people each company is looking for. Not surprisingly, a discernible pattern emerged. Companies look for people with personalities like their own.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When we visited Apple, we asked several people, &quot;What is an Apple person?&quot; They replied: &quot;An Apple person is self-starting, very entrepreneurial, flexible, bright and open to new ideas, not hung up in bureaucracy and politics, not status-conscious, people who are basically themselves, and perhaps just a little arrogant.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apple considers recruitment so important that it hires nearly half of its new people through recommendations of existing employees rather than agency referrals. It is everybody&#39;s responsibility to find the right people. Candidates go through anywhere from 10 to 20 interviews, not only with the manager they will be working under but with their peers as well. Any employee can exercise a veto power if the employee feels the person is someone he or she cannot work with. If people have to be terminated, it is almost always for &quot;cultural&quot; reasons rather than for lack of technical competence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apple does not mind if its people are a bit arrogant. After all, you need a little spunk to keep up the fire with Big Blue hovering above your head. By contrast, at Coca-Cola arrogance is considered the deadliest of all sins. Coca-Cola looks for people who are extremely bright, articulate, with integrity and a sense of style&mdash;not those who take themselves too seriously (after all, it is not a very serious product), and definitely not those who are arrogant. &quot;A symptom of arrogance is a serious problem,&quot; says Don Keough, the president, who is constantly looking at the character of the executives as much as or more than their professional competence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Why knock arrogance? When you control 40 percent of the world market for anything, the worst enemy you face is your own sense of importance, satisfaction, and complacency. Coca-Cola fears that more than it fears Pepsico. Keough explains, &quot;Woodruff said that the world belonged to the discontented, and it does. The one thing that we fight is that thumb-sucking attitude that we have arrived. The joy of this business is the joy of trying to improve on what you are doing, because success is a journey, not a destination.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The people we met at Merck seemed to be cast in the image of the company itself&mdash;intelligent, dynamic, aggressive, and articulate. How do you know Merck people when you see them? Elliot Margolis, executive director of field administration, replied:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">When you look at them, there&#39;s somebody home. There&#39;s a light behind the eyes, and you can see all the circuits clicking at a million miles an hour. The individual has a certain presence. We are looking for people who have a high energy level, very high impact. We want them to have initiative, to be highly motivated, to have good presentation skills, and to be good communicators and good problem solvers. We want creativity and tenacity. Now I&#39;m not talking about somebody who walks on water,&hellip;but we&#39;ll take that, too!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Contrast the emphasis on independence and entrepreneurship at Coca-Cola and Merck with this description. &quot;We&#39;re looking for someone that is going to be compatible with this environment&mdash;a caring person, a quality person, a positive person. Someone who is too independent and ambitious, with little regard for others, is not going to work out here. If they are not willing to play as a team member, they are not going to fit in,&quot; says James Ehrenstrom, vice-president of personnel at Northwestern Mutual. At Northwestern Mutual the team comes first, individual ambition only afterward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Aside from what the companies told us, our own impression was that you simply could not shuffle people around between them without coming up with some striking mismatches. The difference in the personality of the people was as great as the contrast between the personalities of the companies themselves.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">What the Taxi Driver Did Not Tell Us</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All of these corporations recognized that intelligence, education, technical training, skills, and experience are not enough to qualify a person for a particular job. But no place we visited took the task of hiring the right kind of people as seriously as Delta.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Delta has about 36,000 employees. Every six months the company receives about 150,000 new or updated job applications without even advertising; that is, 4 or 5 applications for every single position in the company. About 50,000 applications are for one of the company&#39;s 6,500 flight attendant jobs. From all these flight attendant applicants, Delta selects a total of 500 to 700 new employees a year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You would certainly think that with so many people trying to get into the company and the high priority Delta places on thrift, it might regard recruiting as a casual affair and simply select a few from the cream of the applications on file. But that is not the Delta way. For a new class of 50 flight attendants, the company interviews about 500 applicants. Even temporary hires are sent to Atlanta from elsewhere in the country for a final round of interviews before being selected.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is Delta looking for? Delta personnel we interviewed say that education is not a very important consideration; it just so happens that most Delta employees have a lot of it. A large number of flight attendants have MBAs or other graduate degrees. Basically, Delta is looking for members of the family. That does not mean members of their existing employees&#39; families. That is strictly prohibited in order to avoid the possibility of hurting anyone&#39;s feelings by turning down a relative. The company is looking for people who belong, and a person&#39;s family background is one important indicator. A person&#39;s background tells a great deal that would otherwise be difficult to learn. A person&#39;s traits and talents are determined by family background, upbringing, and self-motivation. The values, beliefs, education, and occupation of the parents can be very revealing clues to a person&#39;s character.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">&quot;We&#39;re looking for someone that has wholesomeness,&quot; says Marvin Johnson, assistant vice-president for employment, &quot;people who can express themselves, who can relate to their peers, service-oriented individuals. They don&#39;t have to be the richest, nor the best educated, because we hire them based on how they fit in and how they will grow with Delta. There is a thread of that Delta person. The fiber of the individual doesn&#39;t differ as much as it appears on their outward expressions.&quot; Delta is quite successful in discovering people with that thread. Of those that join the company, only 3 percent leave of their own accord every year. When you consider that many of those that do leave are young flight attendants interrupting their careers to become mothers, you begin to understand just how much a family Delta really is.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Knack</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">On April 1, 1980, Chrysler called a meeting that was attended by representatives from 400 American and foreign lending institutions to which the company owed $4.75 billion. The meeting was a last desperate effort to persuade the banks to approve $655 million in financial concessions so that Chrysler could become eligible for the $1.5 billion in loan guarantees granted by the U.S. government.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">According to provisions of the government guarantees, every single one of the 400 banks and insurance companies had to agree to the concessions. They all stood to lose 90 percent of their loans to the company if it failed. Yet Chrysler found them far more difficult to persuade than the entire U.S. Congress. The bankers were constantly squabbling among themselves, and some seemed more inclined to write off their loans than to approve the package of concessions. Chrysler was making one final attempt to push the package through before it ran out of cash.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the meeting began, Chrysler&#39;s chief financial officer, Steve Miller, rose to address the group:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Gentlemen, last night Chrysler&#39;s board of directors held an emergency meeting. In view of the terrible economy, the declining fortunes of the company, and skyrocketing interest rates&mdash;not to mention the lack of support that we&#39;ve had from our lenders&mdash;at nine-thirty this morning we decided to file for bankruptcy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The room was silent. It suddenly dawned on all the people present what the consequences would be if they failed to come to an agreement. Miller paused for a few moments to let the reality of the situation sink in and then added, &quot;I should probably remind you all that today is the first of April.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt94" id="ftnt_ref94">[94]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Miller&#39;s ploy worked. During the meeting, the concession plan was accepted by all the banks. Chrysler was saved.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As Iacocca has remarked, &quot;Miller had the perfect personality for the job. He was tough and well-organized.&hellip;&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt95" id="ftnt_ref95">[95]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;But in this case, personality strength, motivation, and intelligence were not enough. By themselves they could never have persuaded the bankers to give in. Miller also relied on his consummate skills in negotiating. It was his skill that enabled him to express his other capacities effectively and accomplish the unenviable mission he had accepted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skills are the instruments through which personality translates intention into accomplished action. Our values and goals give us a direction; our character and will provide the energy and strength to pursue it; our skills are the precision tools through which we direct our energy to achieve the desired result.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skills are habits of our personality that we have consciously acquired for effective execution of work. Every action requires an expenditure of energy. When an action is done with skill, the energy expended is less, and the act is more perfect. A skill is the capacity to carefully control the energy that is expressed in movements, making them more precise and refined, like the graceful, easy movements of a dancer or a gymnast. An action done with skill is more effective in achieving its purpose and more efficient in its utilization of energy, time, and materials.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Habits</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We think of structure, systems, and values as characteristics of organizations. We usually think of skills as characteristics of individuals. It is true that a company&#39;s skills are expressed through its people, but companies do acquire characteristic skills of their own, which are not merely the sum total of skills possessed by their employees. Different companies acquire a high level of skill in certain areas, which they come to possess independently of the particular people who presently happen to be working for them. These corporate skills characterize a company&#39;s behavior and distinguish it from other companies. The courtesy and efficiency of a Marriott hotel receptionist are not just qualities of an individual. They reflect attitudes and skills that are imparted by the company to receptionists in all its hotels. The selling skills and service orientation of IBM representatives have become something of a legend in the marketplace. A combination of careful recruitment and comprehensive training is required to create such a consistently high level of behavior by thousands of employees. Even if most of the present employees at Disneyland left the company, next year you would find the new staff behaving in the same cheerful, friendly manner as the old, because at Disneyland pleasant, courteous behavior is a corporate skill.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Skills are corporate habits. They are the instruments through which an organization expresses its personality. No matter how high a company&#39;s values, how strong its character, how coordinated and integrated its systems, the practical results of corporate action depend to a very great extent on the quality of the skills it possesses. Skills are the final link in the chain connecting intentions with actions. The decisions of top management determine a company&#39;s direction; the will of the organization determines its strength; systems determine its efficiency; and skills determine the quality of its performance.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Why Talk of Skills?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You may be wondering why we should be going back to such a basic subject as skills when every company on earth recognized their importance decades ago. Admittedly, systems is an area where every company can improve&mdash;but skills? In our view, skills is, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our reasons are twofold. First, there are many types of skills, and traditionally companies recruit and train only for some of them. Every company recognizes the productive value of physical and technical skills. But there are others that are even more essential to corporate success&mdash;interpersonal, organizational, and managerial skills&mdash;that get much less attention than they deserve. And there are still others&mdash;what might be termed psychological skills&mdash;that possess an enormous productive power yet are almost completely neglected. Second, there is wide variation in the level or quality of skills companies possess. When we say that an individual is skilled, we imply that the individual possesses both the necessary types of skills for his or her work and a high level of competence in them. The phrase </span><span class="c2">skilled driver</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;does not distinguish the housewife who has been driving her children to school safely for ten years from the professional test-car driver who has survived ten years of high-speed competition without a major accident. The difference is in the level of skill. Here, too, there is an enormous scope for improvement. Let us begin by enumerating the important types of skills required by modern corporations.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Physical Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A physical skill is one that involves fine control and coordination of physical movements. Typing neatly without errors, balancing dishes on your arm, flipping pancakes without dropping them, counting dollar bills quickly, serving drinks on a bouncing airplane, cleaning glass without leaving streaks on it, packing a suitcase so that clothes do not get wrinkled, keeping one&#39;s desk and drawers clean and orderly are basic physical skills required in business.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How many companies actually enumerate all of the physical skills required to do each job perfectly and recruit or train people accordingly? When hiring a typist, companies usually look for one or two skills and very often get only what they looked for. At least one middle-sized company we know did not even do that. It hired several secretaries who did not know how to type! Typing quickly without errors is only part of the job. There are secretaries who can do that but cannot fold a letter into three equal parts or file papers systematically or answer the telephone in a friendly manner or report a message </span><span class="c2">accurately</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to the boss or remember the work that has been assigned to them. Has your secretary ever come in with a letter you drafted three weeks ago and gave for typing but that was misplaced and never went out? These are not all physical skills, but they are all essential skills for doing the job well. How sweet and easy life becomes when you have a secretary who places papers on your desk in a neat and orderly fashion with each sheet in its right, logical sequence and nothing missing. But for many executives, that is just a dream.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Technical Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A technical skill is one that requires mental knowledge of a mechanical apparatus or process. Technical skills have been an essential part of production, maintenance, research, and product development for a long time. But with the extension of sophisticated automated equipment to the office, the need for technical skills has dramatically increased, even for nonproduction jobs. Many people are struggling to cope with all these newfangled gadgets. Have you ever noticed cashiers taking longer to ring up a sale on an electronic register than on the old manual machines? Probably the staff received a half-hour demonstration and a few minutes of training. They learn the skill while the customer waits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most companies certainly do acquire technical skills in many, if not all, of the areas where they are required. Our point is that very often the level of competence attained is barely the minimum that is necessary to function and only rarely the maximum that is required for high performance. Frequently, complete training is given to only one or two persons in a department, and the others are expected to pick it up from them. IBM learned the value of maximum-level technical skills 40 years ago. Semiskilled machine operators used to sit idle for several hours a week waiting for the set-up person to come around. Then Tom Watson suggested that the operators be taught to set the machines themselves. All that was needed was a few days of additional training. As a result, output and quality of production both increased, and so did job satisfaction. When the company made the jobs bigger, workers were more interested and more enthused about their work. Enlarging the scope of each job and expanding the skills of each worker became corporate policy at IBM.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Organizational Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As an engineer must have the ability to make machines work properly, an executive must be skilled in making systems run smoothly. Organizational skill is the ability to execute work in a methodical and systematic manner. Orderliness and punctuality&mdash;the capacity to arrange tasks in the most efficient sequence and to execute them at the appropriate time&mdash;are the hallmarks of organizational skill. Of this capacity Lawrence Appley, former president of the American Management Association, said:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Human beings are, by nature, unorganized and they resist orderliness. Organizing one&#39;s work is a matter of discipline and concentration.&hellip;If you want to know what to expect to see in a plant, in the way of maintenance and house-keeping, visit first the superintendent&#39;s office. The chances are pretty good that if he and his work are orderly and neat, the plant will reflect it. If he is sloppy and disorganized himself, you are quite likely to find that reflected also.&hellip;Organizing one&#39;s own work is a management skill, and when it is exercised to a high degree, it is reflected throughout an entire organization.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt96" id="ftnt_ref96">[96]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is easy to recognize the presence or absence of organizational skills in a company as a whole. Long lines at the service counters, late departure of shipments, sending the wrong product to the wrong customer or the right product at the wrong time, delays of all types, waste of every description and variety, disorderly stockrooms and missing inventory, misplaced correspondence, lost orders or money, and general confusion are a few of the symptoms that organizational skills are lacking.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Some companies excel in the strength of their organizational skills. Marriott&#39;s capacity to open up 15 to 20 major hotels a year while maintaining high-quality service in all its older ones is a premier example of corporate organizational skills.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Social Skill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A social, or interpersonal, skill is the capacity to carry out a task involving other people effectively in a socially acceptable or pleasing manner. Giving a helpful suggestion to a colleague, correcting the errors of a subordinate, revealing a fatal flaw in the boss&#39;s pet scheme, selling anything, replying to a letter politely, displaying tact in handling problems and complaints, negotiating a contract, motivating others to work harder, and clearly communicating your ideas and intentions are just a few of the areas in which social skills become important. John Huck, of Merck, says: &quot;Most very good people who don&#39;t succeed, don&#39;t succeed because they do not relate well with people. Interpersonal skill [when it is absent] is the skill that most frequently is the reason for failure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Social skills are required at every level and in every department of a company, because interpersonal relationships are an activity in which every employee is engaged almost all of the time. Some companies have recognized the importance of these skills and actively recruit or train for them, particularly in the areas of customer service, negotiations, communications, and sales.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Delta social skills are of vital importance for expressing one of the company&#39;s core values&mdash;warm southern hospitality in customer service. Delta wants its flight attendants to treat every passenger as they would a guest in their own home, with natural courtesy and pleasantness. That requires selecting people with friendly and cheerful dispositions and instilling a positive attitude toward the people they serve.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Teamwork and cooperation are near to the heart of Northwestern Mutual&#39;s personality, and the company recognizes that interpersonal skills are essential for fostering these values. At Northwestern Mutual, as in many companies we visited, the most common reason for a manager&#39;s not getting along is lack of skill in working as part of a team rather than lack of technical competence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Social skills for communicating can be of critical importance. As Ron Allen, of Delta, put it: &quot;Generally, when we have a problem in the company, it is not a problem in policy or procedure; it is a problem in communication. We managers have not done a good enough job in communicating. We haven&#39;t been good listeners, or we haven&#39;t been clear enough or taken enough time to communicate the real intent of what we are trying to do.&quot; Since good communications are critical for maintaining a family atmosphere, Delta has institutionalized this skill through periodic meetings between top management and personnel all over the country, in which the executives discuss the company&#39;s objectives and suggestions from employees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Communication skills are required at the lowest as well as the highest levels of a company. Anyone can answer a telephone, but not everyone can handle a call from an irate customer who just spent five days trying to make a new computer work properly, only to discover that the machine is defective. That requires calm nerves, a soft voice, plenty of patience and humility, and a genuine capacity to please other people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coca-Cola&#39;s recent negotiations with 250 independent bottlers illustrate the importance of social skills for negotiating. Under the perpetual-franchise contract Coca-Cola signed in 1899, its U.S. bottlers have a fair amount of leverage over the company. Yet Coca-Cola succeeded in reorganizing and revitalizing the entire distribution system through the negotiation process. As one executive expressed it: &quot;This is a company that has to use persuasion almost above every other business ability. Every ounce that we can pull out of this bottler system is done to a great degree by persuasion.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Social skills are indispensable for IBM to fulfill its mission of being the best sales organization and giving the best customer service of any company in the world. IBM was not the first to market a commercial computer. Remington Rand did that in 1951 with its Univac computer. Although Univac was considered technically superior as a product, IBM was far more successful in dispelling customer resistance to the new technology. By 1956 the race was over. When the dust cleared, IBM had won 85 percent of the U.S. computer market, and it has never looked back since. As </span><span class="c2">Time</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;put it, IBM&#39;s &quot;salesmen were so knowledgeable and thoroughly trained that their very presence inspired confidence.&hellip;More than anything else, it was IBM&#39;s awesome sales skills that enabled the company to capture the computer market.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt97" id="ftnt_ref97">[97]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Managerial Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Physical, technical, organizational, and social skills are capacities that can be possessed by an individual and expressed in his or her work without reference to the work of other people or an organization. But there are also higher-order skills that are broader in their scope and that influence a wider field of activity. These are managerial skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">An organization consists of many individual resources&mdash;people, ideas, time, energy, money, materials, and so forth. It also consists of many physical, technical, social, and organizational skills&mdash;orderliness, punctuality, technical know-how, social poise, the ability to communicate, the capacity to organize, and so on. Managerial skills have the ability to combine, coordinate, and integrate the utilization of all these resources and the expression of all these skills in order to accomplish the goals of the organization. Managerial skills have the power to unite all these things for a common purpose. Managerial skills involve the capacity to conceive of a work in its entirety, seeing all the relationships between its component parts, to plan out all the necessary steps for its accomplishment, and to direct execution in order to complete the task with the resources available for the purpose.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Managerial skills are possessed not only by individuals. They can become institutionalized by a company as part of its capacity to execute work. In other words, companies as well as individuals can be characterized by their managerial skills. These skills are of several types.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. </span><span class="c2">Conceptual skills</span><span class="c3">. Managers should have the ability to understand their work in its totality and conceive of its place in the wider organizational framework. In the absence of this skill, each person, activity, or department functions in isolation or opposition to others. The organization is fragmented, inefficient, and chaotic. You have a situation like Geneen described&mdash;everyone &quot;thinking of his own terrain, his own people, his own duties and responsibilities, and no one thinking of the company as a whole.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt98" id="ftnt_ref98">[98]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;General Mills tries to actively foster this wider perspective among its managers in order to preserve the integrity of a highly decentralized organization of semiautonomous divisions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. </span><span class="c2">Planning and decision-making skills</span><span class="c3">. Thinking work out in advance, planning, and making decisions are crucial management skills. Planning identifies objectives. Decision making provides the will to achieve them. Unfortunately, these two skills are often exercised in isolation from each other. Planning without deciding is like a Barmecide feast&mdash;sheer speculation. Deciding before planning is to act before you think&mdash;impulsiveness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many companies draw up estimates of future performance over a quarter, a year, or a decade based on current trends and then watch to see how close their projections were to their actual performance. They use planning as a tool for prediction, like the weather forecaster, without ever linking it to the decision-making process. These companies possess only half of the skill. Planning becomes a meaningful management skill only when it forms the basis for decisions. Companies that decide what their performance should be and set the plan projection as a goal to be realized combine the conceptual powers of the mind with the executive powers of the will. ITT under Geneen was a classic example of this type. Geneen understood the power of an idea, a goal, when it is supported by a decision. &quot;Decide what it is you want to do and then start doing it,&quot; he said.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt99" id="ftnt_ref99">[99]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Planning supported by a commitment to act links the objective of the psychic center to the will of the organization. The decision is critical. As Iacocca said, &quot;If I had to sum up in one word the qualities that make a good manager, I&#39;d say it all comes down to decisiveness.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt100" id="ftnt_ref100">[100]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. </span><span class="c2">Skill in exercising authority</span><span class="c3">. The exercise of authority involves controlling people through discipline and motivating them positively through freedom and delegation of responsibility. The strength for exercising authority comes from the will, but the expression is basically a skill. A great deal of skill is required by a manager or an organization to exercise authority in the right form and measure to suit every situation. When the skill is absent, the organization is either threatened by anarchy as Chrysler was before Iacocca or stifled by authoritarianism as Ford was during the 1930s.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The manager&#39;s authority is derived from functional position and role within the organization, not from personality. Yet many managers behave as though the power they wield is their very own and they should be implicitly obeyed, just because they demand it. When authority is exercised as a form of personal power, it rubs people the wrong way and offends them. They become aggressive, defensive, resistant, or resentful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It requires skill to exercise authority as the job requires it in order to get work done properly without asserting one&#39;s ego. It requires skill to know when to explain and when to instruct. Often an instruction cannot be executed properly unless it is preceded by a lengthy explanation to clarify the intention. But when a lengthy explanation is given to justify a disagreeable decision, it erodes the manager&#39;s authority. It requires skill to correct the shortcomings of subordinates without creating offense or bitterness. Perhaps the greatest skill of all is required for a manager to relate to subordinates in a friendly manner without undermining his or her authority or relinquishing power by becoming one of the group.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. </span><span class="c2">Time-management skills</span><span class="c3">. Management of time is a complex skill that involves planning, decision making, organization, and delegation of work. Most managers are continuously involved in work, but that does not mean they maximize the utilization of time. Managing time effectively means to always be doing the most important work to be done and delegating other responsibilities to subordinates. Most managers plan out their schedule for the week or the month. How about planning for tomorrow morning?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The clearer the mind and the more detailed the planning, the better the management of time. But time management also depends on strength of will. The stronger the will, the faster the work is accomplished. When we are tired or indecisive or weak, discussions drag on, decisions get postponed, and work gets delayed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Utilizing time to the maximum requires quickness but not hurrying. Hurrying is a nervous trait connoting agitation, stress, impatience, and anxiety. An efficient manager or company learns to think, decide, and act at high speed without agitation or disturbance. For Tomas Bata, &quot;If anything had to be done, it had to be done on time.&hellip;All the planning techniques and administrative organization were nothing but instruments helping the human will and resolution to do things on time.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt101" id="ftnt_ref101">[101]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. </span><span class="c2">Skill in developing people</span><span class="c3">. The most important managerial skill for the long-term growth of the organization is the ability to identify and develop human potentials, to recognize unexpressed talents in individuals, to help them acquire new or greater skills, and to delegate responsibilities that will bring out and fully utilize all their latent capacities. The greatest power a manager or an organization can wield is not the power of money or technology. It is the power of people. The ultimate art of management is to foster the growth of the organization by fostering the personal growth of the individuals within it. When a corporation has as its highest value the development and fulfillment of the individual, and when it possesses the knowledge and the will to strive toward this goal, it releases power for endless expansion and a self-generating momentum for enduring success.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Psychological Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Finally, there is a whole range of abilities that are basic psychological skills of living. They are extremely useful for managing a wide range of situations in life and become more and more indispensable as one rises to higher levels of human interaction.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. </span><span class="c2">Factual reporting</span><span class="c3">. Learning to distinguish a factual from a false report is not easy. People tend to report their thoughts, opinions, and interpretations instead of the facts. Managers who fall prey to inaccuracies, exaggerations, rumors, gossip, and unfounded criticism of other staff members invariably land in trouble. &quot;The highest art of professional management,&quot; according to Geneen, &quot;requires the literal ability to &#39;smell&#39; a &#39;real fact&#39; from all others.&quot; A manager must become &quot;a connoisseur of&hellip;unshakeable facts.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt102" id="ftnt_ref102">[102]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. </span><span class="c2">Listening</span><span class="c3">. Listening is a skill and an art. Most people are anxious to talk and express their ideas. The person who knows how to let the other person speak has the skill and self-control needed for growth. As Delta&#39;s Hollis Harris said: &quot;The most important skill for a manager is being able to deal with people. A good people person knows how to listen, has to train himself how to listen. You have to work on it. You have to have the capacity to relate to people at their level.&quot; Bill Marriott, Jr., remarked: &quot;Managers get in trouble when they stop listening to their staff. If you stop listening to your people, you&#39;re in big trouble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. </span><span class="c2">Empathy</span><span class="c3">. Once when Churchill visited the United States to meet President Roosevelt, FDR gave instructions that no one in his party should mention the name of Jawaharlal Nehru, who was then leading India&#39;s campaign for total independence from Britain. At the mention of Nehru&#39;s name, Churchill had been known to fly into a rage, and FDR wanted to avoid any embarrassing situation. Despite the president&#39;s instructions, while he and Churchill were chatting at a reception, one of the guests asked Churchill a question about Nehru. FDR quickly intervened with a blank expression on his face, &quot;Which Nehru?&quot; Churchill was pleased beyond measure by Roosevelt&#39;s feigned ignorance and kept his composure.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The capacity to know how another person thinks and feels and to honor his or her thoughts and sentiments is a consummate skill in human relations. One of the keys to Delta&#39;s high quality of service is C. E. Woolman&#39;s constant admonition to his employees that they &quot;put themselves on the other side of the counter,&quot; identify with the needs of the customer. This skill is central to Coca-Cola&#39;s management philosophy, too. &quot;You have to be able to see things from the other person&#39;s point of view,&quot; one executive explained.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. </span><span class="c2">Judging people</span><span class="c3">. Perhaps the greatest skill a manager can possess is the capacity to judge people&#39;s character, motives, and abilities objectively and perceptively. Contrary to common belief, it is a capacity that can be acquired through training. Woodruff, who was notable for his lack of other talents, possessed this one in good measure. &quot;He has an ability for finding good men,&quot; as one Coca-Cola executive said. Iacocca acquired this skill from the psychology courses he took during college. He says, &quot;As a result of this training I learned to figure people out pretty quickly.&hellip;That&#39;s an important skill to have.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt103" id="ftnt_ref103">[103]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. </span><span class="c2">Self-awareness</span><span class="c3">. Have you ever seen someone repeating the same old folly for the umpteenth time as if it were the very first and being shocked or outraged when it once again leads to trouble? Just about everyone does it. Our lives consist of many patterns that tend to repeat over and over. The capacity to observe these patterns in the lives of other people and of organizations gives a great and very useful knowledge. Observe, for instance, the recurring pattern of crisis that overtakes Chrysler once every decade, getting a little worse each time. The capacity to observe the same patterns in our own lives brings wisdom and power for enduring success.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">6. </span><span class="c2">Silent will</span><span class="c3">. Speaking pleasantly carries a power. &quot;There is a force hidden in a sweet command,&quot; so goes the proverb. Speaking sparingly carries an even greater power. &quot;A great man is sparing in words but prodigal in deeds,&quot; said Confucius.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt104" id="ftnt_ref104">[104]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;And silence creates the greatest power of all. &quot;Nothing,&quot; wrote de Gaulle, &quot;more enhances authority than silence.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt105" id="ftnt_ref105">[105]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The English writer Thomas Carlyle once commented that &quot;silence is the element in which great things fashion themselves together; that at length they may emerge, full formed and majestic, into the daylight of Life, which they are thenceforth to rule.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt106" id="ftnt_ref106">[106]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The two types of speakers that are most effective are the ones who speak in a loud voice, projecting their energies into the audience, and the ones who speak very softly, so that the audience must strain to hear. Of the two, the first is more dramatic but the second can be infinitely more powerful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Controlling the volume and intensity of speech to a soft or moderate level is far more difficult than it sounds. It requires self-restraint. When an idea or question enters the mind, it creates a powerful urge for expression that can be hard to contain. When you are able to master that urge by postponing expression until the proper moment and then speaking in a soft tone, using only the minimum number of words necessary, your words carry a far greater power for effecting results.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One of the most important applications of this skill is in meetings. Each person present in a group has his or her own ideas, opinions, preferences, and suggestions about what should or should not be done. The moment you express your idea, there is a good chance of raising opposition and counterarguments from others, which neutralize or cancel your suggestion, no matter how good the idea may be. But if you restrain the urge for expression, very often the same idea will be expressed by others or your very silence will evoke a more favorable atmosphere and an invitation to speak.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When people speak softly, they think more clearly, work more efficiently, feel calmer and fresher than otherwise. When an organization practices soft speech, it becomes charged with a tremendous power. If the effort starts with top management and works its way down, two things will become apparent. Speaking softly is one of the most effective means of improving performance, and it is also one of the most difficult! All right, if you cannot follow it completely, at least reduce the volume of voice by 10 percent. Efficiency will double.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Ultimate Skill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Each person develops one or two skills to a higher level than the average. This is the individual&#39;s strong point, which he or she likes to display as often as possible. If the person is a good mechanic, she takes every opportunity to inspect or comment on the operation of a machine. If the person is a good communicator, he is always looking for somebody to communicate something to. Whether the person&#39;s skill is in settling quarrels, judging people, making people happy, designing systems, or cutting costs, he or she constantly seeks opportunities to express it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">So far, so good. The problem comes when someone insists on extending a skill to areas where it is ineffective or inappropriate. &quot;To a hammer,&quot; says an old proverb, &quot;everything looks like a nail.&quot; The car mechanic starts tinkering with a computer. The communicator communicates confidential information. The cost cutter tries to hold down expenditure in a new experimental R&amp;D project. The manager who makes people happy tries to please customers by reducing prices to below cost or tries to please his or her staff when they disobey legitimate authority.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The skill of skills is to know what is the proper time and place for exercising&mdash;and refraining from exercising&mdash;each skill. The ultimate skill is the capacity to organize all our other skills, coordinate their expression, and rightly choose which one to express in each particular circumstance.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Levels of Skill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For even the simplest task, there is an almost infinite gradation of levels of skill, ranging from total incompetence to perfection. Perfection may be a difficult goal to achieve and maintain, but it is a wonderful standard by which to evaluate present performance and motivate improvement.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Take a simple physical skill like typing a letter. Speed is only one criterion of perfection. There are many other skills involved in typing: feeding paper into the typewriter straight, keeping proper margins, punctuating and hyphenating at the appropriate places, spelling correctly, spacing, numbering pages in exactly the same place on each page with the right numbers, error-free correspondence, and so on. Trying to type a single page perfectly according to all these criteria is a challenge for most typists. Typing one page perfectly may have very little value indeed, but acquiring the skill required to type every page perfectly gives a tremendous boost to any organization. There are two reasons. First, doing any activity with imperfect skill generates tension, boredom, frustration, and fatigue. Second, doing any activity with perfect skill releases energy, enthusiasm, and joy. This applies not only to typing and other physical skills but to all types of activities and all levels of skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everyone has a long list of hated tasks, like driving in rush-hour traffic, processing administrative paperwork, keeping travel expense accounts, telling subordinates to shape up or ship out, presenting a new budget to the board, and so forth. But there are people who enjoy every one of these tasks and even find them a thrilling challenge. Many of the things we dislike doing are things we lack the skill to do easily and well. Instead of acquiring the necessary skills, we shun the tasks. When skills are perfect, even driving across Manhattan in late afternoon can be an exhilarating experience. Presenting a budget with brief, clean, confident, and precise explanations can be much more so.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Most acts involve many levels of skill. Driving during rush hour requires more than smooth, quick, coordinated movements. You need calm nerves, patience, and preferably a cheerful disposition that does not get angry or irritated every time another car cuts in front of you. An ability to think while you drive makes the time spent productive and reduces the strain. All of these capacities can be cultivated. How much more complex, challenging, and potentially rewarding are the other activities we consider boring, routine, or despicable? Delivering a speech, keeping accurate travel expense accounts, making a sale, interviewing a job candidate, communicating an idea&mdash;all involve a multiplicity of skills that can be improved without limit. The scope for growth is infinite.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">On the surface of it, the job of a bank teller offers very little challenge or charm. But if all the relevant skills are present, this need not be so. The following scene took place a few years ago at a southern California bank branch in a middle-class, predominantly white neighborhood on the day before Christmas. All the tellers were at their windows to handle the last-minute rush for Christmas shopping. There were 7 or 8 customers waiting in front of most of the windows, and the tellers were going about their business as usual. But in front of one window there were at least 20 customers waiting patiently, many of them carrying gifts in their hands. The teller at this particular window was a tall, ungainly young black woman with rather unattractive facial features but a broad, almost irresistible, smile. The counters around her were piled high with presents that she had received in the course of the morning, and the long line in front of her window consisted of other customers waiting to wish her a Merry Christmas and perhaps give a present, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everyone knew the secret of the woman&#39;s popularity. She was a naturally happy person who took pleasure in making other people happy rather than in just satisfying the customers. We satisfy customers when we provide them with a good-quality product or service at a reasonable price while treating them with courtesy and respect. We please people when we relate to them as individuals with a genuine desire to make them happy. This woman had the physical skills necessary to provide good, prompt service, the social skills required to please people, and the right temperament. Not only were customers pleased but she drew immense personal enjoyment from her work because she was so well suited for it. The right skill and the right personality combined to generate high productivity, the appreciation of customers, and personal fulfillment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The satisfaction that the bank teller derived from fully exercising her skills on a job for which she was ideally suited can come to any person at any level whose skills are well developed and appropriate for the work. Harold Geneen found &quot;the fun, the enjoyment, the pride, and the sense of self-fulfillment&quot; at the highest level of corporate activity.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt107" id="ftnt_ref107">[107]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The bank teller found it at the lowest level. A company that recruits the right people for each job and helps them acquire all of the skills required to attain the highest level of proficiency taps a great productive power that is now only partially utilized. It eliminates a major source of frustration and conflict in work and releases the joy of skilled execution in its people.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Knowledge of a Skill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We usually think of a skill as a physical capacity for a particular type of behavior or action, like repairing a machine, writing a report, or communicating an idea. The behavioral part of the skill is what is usually acquired by training. But there is another component to every skill&mdash;the knowledge of how and why the skill is effective. Theoretically, the mechanic can repair a machine even without understanding how it works, as many people use computers without any clear idea of how they actually function. But the knowledge part of each skill is extremely important for upgrading the level of performance beyond the minimum. Merck has recognized that the effectiveness of professional representatives can be immeasurably enhanced by broadening and deepening their technical knowledge of medicine. Many Merck representatives are treated as professional peers by physicians because of the depth of their knowledge. Merck also believes that the representatives must know the importance of factual presentations. The company not only insists on honest behavior; it also imparts a clear knowledge of why credibility is so important.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The capacity to sell at the wholesale level depends on a knowledge of the product, how it is produced, how it is utilized, and how it is repaired or maintained. It also depends on a knowledge of the buyers, their business, and their customers. This capacity can be significantly improved by acquiring a greater knowledge of people and human nature as Iacocca did. The same is true for every skill involved in managing people. There is no end to the opportunities for improvement.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The knowledge of a skill has several levels. The operators of a machine must know how to run it. If they know how to repair it, too, their skill as operators is greater. If they understand how the machine is designed and constructed, it is even higher. If they also know the principle upon which the machine functions, then and then only is their knowledge complete, and the skill can be perfected.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The accountant&#39;s skill as a controller depends entirely on his or her knowledge of the smallest details of the business. The greater the accountant&#39;s knowledge of production, administration, marketing, and research, the greater the capacity to control expenses effectively with maximum benefit to the company.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Value Implementation Through Skills</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The role of skills is so ubiquitous and so vital to the success of a company that it has led many to believe that skills alone are the key to excellence and that high values and organizational structures are only window dressing. There is truth in this observation, but it is a partial truth. A well-developed individual skill is a very powerful tool. A well-coordinated assortment of skills is a formidable weapon. But for enduring achievement, skill must be inspired by the vision of a goal and commanded by the determination of an inner will. The Taj Mahal is a work of awesome beauty and perfect skill, but its graceful lines and fine details were inspired by an emperor&#39;s love for his deceased wife and his desire to immortalize that love in white marble. Vision and will as much as skill are needed to build a Taj Mahal, a Great Pyramid, a great nation, or a great corporation.</span></p><a id="id.ofzp1laeckj3"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Nevertheless, the contribution of skill to any high accomplishment is truly enormous and all-pervasive. Whatever a company&#39;s values and goals, ultimately they must be expressed in a thousand small details of life through a vast array of well-developed skills. If skills are lacking, the whole process of value implementation comes to naught. It is like building an atomic power plant, sending out electricity through wires across the country, carrying those wires to millions of houses, and then discovering that all your light bulbs have defective filaments. The result&mdash;no light! It is not enough that the company accepts certain values, establishes standards of performance, and creates systems for achieving them. Every employee must possess all the skills required to make that high ideal a living reality. Figure 4 illustrates the role of skills in the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 327.00px; height: 329.00px;"><img alt="The role of skills in the corporate personality" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 327.00px; height: 329.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><a id="id.vw087clmxihd"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c41">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c41">Figure 4 &nbsp;The role of skills in the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is not just managerial and psychological skills at the top and physical and technical skills at the bottom that are needed, but all types of skills at all levels of the organization. The highest psychological skills and the simplest physical ones are necessary for the smooth running of a board meeting. A spilled pot of coffee, wrongly typed numbers, a malfunctioning projector, mixed-up papers, a missing chart, an ill-planned agenda, a poorly chosen word or phrase can all interfere with a billion-dollar decision. So, too, the highest psychological and managerial abilities are necessary for perfect functioning on the factory floor or out in the field. A supervisor who acts on a false piece of information, a manager who moves too closely with his or her team to command their obedience, a sales rep who is late for an appointment, a mishandled machine, a wrongly typed price list, a telephone operator who is cold or rude to an important customer&mdash;all can have a serious impact on overall corporate performance. And they do have a serious impact on every company every day.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As the organization develops, each individual and collective skill has to become more and more smoothly coordinated and fully integrated with other skills at the same level and at other levels of the organization. Factual reporting by top executives is fruitless if the same habit is not acquired at all the levels of management below, from which data are constantly being received. The same is true of every other skill.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For an organization to become a single, unified, living whole, all these separate strands of skill have to be carefully woven together. This can be done only when top management recognizes the multiplicity of skills it requires for high performance and methodically cultivates them at all levels of the organization by education, training, and proper recruitment. This knowledge has to be translated into precise performance standards for each skill at each level, and these standards must be supported by systems for imparting, monitoring, and evaluating levels of skill.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.7oz4wvpp5jh"><span class="c3">A Delta flight attendant related a story about perfect skill. She was on a DC-9 landing at Chicago. The nose gear would not come down, so the captain instructed the crew to prepare the passengers for an emergency landing and quick evacuation in case of fire. She recalled her fright as the pilot brought down the plane. Everyone was braced for a heavy jolt. The captain landed on the rear wheels in such a way that a secondary mechanism locked the nose gear down in place. The plane rolled to a halt. &quot;We had the smoothest landing I have ever had on any airplane!&quot; she said. &quot;He had to have done something which was just right. Now I like to fly with him.&quot; High corporate achievement and enduring success require the presence of physical, technical, social, organizational, managerial, and psychological skills in every area of functioning and at all levels of the company. Companies that strive for excellence cannot afford to leave anything to chance.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 7 - The Artesian Spring</span></h1><p class="c39"><span class="c3">There is no saturation point in education.</span></p><p class="c39 c55"><span class="c3">&mdash;Thomas J. Watson, Sr</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt108" id="ftnt_ref108">[108]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A famous Indian scholar and statesman once said that it takes centuries of human experience to make a little history, centuries of history to create a little civilization, and centuries of civilization to distill a few drops of culture. Culture is something acquired over millennia; but one man had the ambition to compress all that history into a few months through education.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everyone knows the story of Eliza Doolittle, the poor, illiterate flower girl who was trained by Professor Higgins, a linguistics expert, to acquire the behavior of an English aristocrat. Through an intensive, rigorous, and painstaking effort, Eliza was taught to dress elegantly, walk gracefully, pronounce words aristocratically, reply to questions appropriately, and otherwise conduct herself with the charm and poise of a highly cultured person. Her training was so complete that at her debut in society, another linguistics expert mistook her for a princess of the Hungarian royal family.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Eliza&#39;s father stumbled upon a fortune by good luck, but Eliza discovered something infinitely more valuable through education. She developed some of the latent potentials of her own personality. The same sort of miraculous transformation that Higgins brought about in Eliza education is doing today for millions&mdash;helping them expand their mental horizons, develop their talents, and enrich their personalities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Higgins&#39; formidable accomplishment contains two important lessons for business. The first concerns the power of education; the second, the power of training. What if Eliza had been an educated middle-class girl rather than a &quot;guttersnipe&quot;? Instead of wasting his time teaching her the fundamentals of speech and human conduct, Higgins could have helped Eliza acquire greater intellectual knowledge, sensitivity to other people, or useful and productive skills. As it was, even after the training, Eliza barely knew how to add or subtract. An educated girl would have received the training in much less time and with far greater perfection than Eliza, who was able to maintain her poise only until she got home from her debut in society and then reverted to throwing shoes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Eliza&#39;s training was in the external forms of cultured behavior. Education makes the inner content of personality more cultured. Higgins chose an uneducated girl to teach because he wanted to illustrate dramatically the power of systematic linguistic training. But companies are not after dramatic proof of principles. They are after dramatic results. For that, there is no substitute for education.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The American Revolution</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Education is far more than just a process of acquiring useful knowledge. Education makes the ordinary mind more active and alert. It converts physical energy into mental energy. Education trains the mind to consider many possibilities, to see things from a new and wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for oneself, and to act on one&#39;s own initiative.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In his time Thomas Edison was one in a million. But today education has institutionalized the talents of the genius, so that great inventions and innovations can be made by far more ordinary people. The transistor and computer represent advances at least as great as the light bulb, but how many people even know who invented them?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Education is the foundation and driving force for two of America&#39;s greatest assets&mdash;entrepreneurship and innovation. Education has probably been the single most important factor in making America the world&#39;s leading industrial power. The American people themselves cannot be anything unique, since nearly all of us came from other countries at one time or another. But long before the nations of Europe, our leaders recognized the importance of education and developed a national system that extended education to all levels of the population.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">America&#39;s postwar success was supported to a great extent by the tremendous expansion in higher education generated by the GI Bill of Rights. The aim of the law was to keep the returning GIs out of the workforce. The result was to provide American commerce and industry with a highly educated pool of personnel to fuel an unprecedented economic boom just at a time when educational systems in other nations had broken down. By 1981, 58 percent of the American youth in the 20-to 24-year age group were enrolled in higher-education courses, compared to 37 percent in Sweden and 20 percent to 30 percent in other West European countries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Whatever the deficiencies of our system may be, education has widened our horizons and stimulated freedom of thought, a scientific outlook, original thinking, imagination, social tolerance, an experimental temper, technical innovation, and dreams of perpetual progress. It has also been used as a conscious instrument by the nation for absorbing and assimilating immigrants of widely diverse cultural backgrounds, inculcating in all these various peoples the common values of American culture.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Sun Rises in the East</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Education has demonstrated its tremendous power elsewhere, too. When Admiral Perry sailed into Tokyo harbor with the American fleet in 1857, demanding the opening up of Japan to foreign traders, the traditionally isolationist Japanese were rudely awakened to the reality of their backwardness and impotence in the face of Western industrial technology. One of the very first strategies they adopted to correct this imbalance was to introduce a Western system of compulsory education in 1872, long before many countries in Europe. By the 1930s, education had become a craze in Japan and came to assume even greater importance than it had acquired in the United States. The rise of Japan to its pre-eminent position in the world today is not the product of chance or a miracle. It is the natural result of a century-long endeavor to educate its people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Japan learned its lesson from us very well, and now we are relearning it from the Japanese. In his book </span><span class="c2">Japan as Number One: Lessons for America</span><span class="c3">, Ezra Vogel writes, &quot;If any single factor explains Japanese success, it is the group-directed quest of knowledge.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt109" id="ftnt_ref109">[109]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The Japanese drive to extend formal education has been as vigorous as the country&#39;s efforts to increase its GNP. In 1955 only about one-half of Japanese youth entered high school, and less than 10 percent went on to college. By the late 1970s over 90 percent were completing high school, compared with 80 percent of Americans. Japanese students attend school about one-third more than their American counterparts, for 240 days a year compared to 180 days in the United States; and virtually all Japanese who enter a school complete it. Although the same percentage of college-age youth are attending a university in both the United States and Japan, many more Japanese complete their education. And they do not stop there. In Japan education is an ongoing social activity that continues throughout life&mdash;in study groups, educational tours, and educational courses on television. The Japanese have understood the value of education better than their teachers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The American Higgins</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The importance of education in business has been endlessly debated in this country by just about everyone except Thomas J. Watson, who refused to discuss what he considered an obvious fact. The controversy focuses on the relative value of education and job experience. The old-timers in every company who have worked their way up through the ranks without education resent the value placed on a young greenhorn with a piece of parchment from a college or university. Education is not a substitute for experience, but it enriches an individual in a way that experience alone rarely does. It broadens the mind and makes a person more open to new ideas and new ways of life. It expands and develops the whole personality rather than just giving some specialized skills and working knowledge. Work experience can greatly enhance the effectiveness of an educated person, but it cannot develop the potentials of human personality the way education can.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Despite all the controversy, Watson never doubted the truth for a moment. Oddly enough, he first recognized the importance of education for sales and customer service rather than for research. Nearly 60 years ago he hired 140 college graduates as sales reps, selecting them mostly on the basis of personality and character, which he considered the prime requisites for a good leader. He then put them through a three-month orientation course on the company&#39;s culture and its products, six months of field training, and another two-month course on selling, before appointing them as junior sales reps. He also recruited graduates from technical and engineering colleges to become customer engineers (that is, to repair equipment) after a five-month course in the shop and classroom. Women with college degrees were hired to teach customers the use of the punch-card machines.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Because IBM&#39;s sales reps possessed a high level of general education, they could acquire a high level of technical competence regarding the company&#39;s products and a highly professional manner of conduct in marketing. Their education also enabled the sales reps to better understand the needs of the customer and to identify untapped potentials in the market. These three endowments based on education have made IBM a superb marketing organization in whatever field or country it competes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Watson made education and basic training the foundation for a continuous learning program. In 1932 he established a corporate educational center to provide systematic education to existing employees. As Peter Drucker said: &quot;Watson trained, and trained, and trained. All employees were expected to continue to learn while on the job. But for the men who were considered `IBM&#39;s business&#39;&mdash;that is, for salesmen, servicemen, and sales managers&mdash;continuous training was a way of life.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt110" id="ftnt_ref110">[110]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;By 1940 more than 7,000 factory employees had attended educational courses at the company&#39;s school. Because of this ongoing program, managers who joined IBM when it was still selling manual punch-card machines were able to adjust to the move into electronic computers during the 1950s. As Drucker wrote, &quot;Having grown up in continuous training, they had learned to learn.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Or as Harry Bernhard, IBM&#39;s program director for advanced management development, put it: &quot;Education has made change normal.&quot; Nor did Watson stop there. In 1936 he established the first training school for customers, which, as </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;commented, &quot;achieves the almost incredible sales feat of luring the quarry into camp and fattening it up before dispatching it.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt112" id="ftnt_ref112">[112]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">After World War II, IBM built up a rich reservoir of technically educated people in its research division as well. The company expanded its engineering force by over 400 percent, recruiting mostly new people with M.A.&#39;s and Ph.D.&#39;s. It also promoted a large number of advanced degree holders into high management positions to ensure that management could stay abreast of the rapid changes in technology. When Tom Watson said, &quot;Think,&quot; he really meant it and wanted to be sure his people did it. He understood that education is one luxury you can never have too much of. He said, &quot;There is no saturation point in education.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Consciously or subconsciously IBM came to recognize that there is a qualitative as well as a quantitative difference between education and training. </span><span class="c2">Whatever a person&#39;s inherent capacities, training improves the level of skills available for expressing those capacities; but education increases the level of capacity itself</span><span class="c3">. Training refines the tools of expression; education improves the person. The most intelligent mechanic who has acquired technical skills without a general background of indepth technical knowledge rarely attains the level of competence achieved by the most mediocre engineer. The mechanic may be very effective in repairing a machine; but when it comes to designing or inventing a better one, the engineer&#39;s knowledge will usually prevail over the mechanic&#39;s skills. Companies that mistake technical training for a more practical version of technical education introduce built-in limitations and inefficiencies in their work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">IBM continues to invest heavily in its scholastic tradition. There are several thousand people involved in providing over 4 million student-days of training a year to IBM personnel at a cost of more than $100 million. All of IBM&#39;s 42,000 managers are required to have at least 40 hours of additional training a year, including 32 hours of training in people-management skills. There are also special outside programs for executives at leading educational institutions. According to Ed Krieg, corporate director of educational programs, &quot;IBM believes that without its intensive educational program, the company would lose maybe 35 percent of its effectiveness.&quot; This enormous investment in the education and training of IBM employees lends credence to Watson&#39;s claim: &quot;You can take my factories, burn up my buildings, but give me my people and I&#39;ll build the business right back again.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt113" id="ftnt_ref113">[113]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">An Asset More Valuable than Money</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Watson was not the only business leader to discover the value of education. Tomas Bata did, too. But Bata did not have the luxury of recruiting college-educated people for his company because there were virtually none available in Czechoslovakia at the time. Instead, he decided to educate them himself. His son, Thomas Bata, explained: &quot;One of the crucial events and decisions which made it possible for this organization to grow explosively in the thirties and again in the fifties and sixties was really the establishment of a college in 1924.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The college offered a three-or four-year course that involved a full day of work in Bata&#39;s factory followed by classes every night. These classes covered general subjects like economics and accounting as well as technical subjects related to the shoe business. The first year, the college received 600 applications for a class of 80. Within a few years the class had grown to 1,000, and the number of applicants was around 35,000. Initially, all the students were from the local area, but by 1930 about 200 students a year were coming from foreign countries. Most of the graduates of the college became managers within the company; the brighter ones were appointed department heads; and some with unusual abilities were sent overseas in search of raw materials or markets and to establish Bata&#39;s foreign subsidiaries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the Nazis sealed the Czech borders and later when the Communists expropriated the company&#39;s assets, it was this core of managers, who were raised and educated at the college in the Bata tradition, that ran Bata&#39;s foreign companies without any control or support from headquarters and then united to rebuild the company after the war. Education proved to be a more valuable asset than all the company&#39;s buildings, money, and machines.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Well</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People have a way of believing in possibilities only after they have become actualities. We can understand the skepticism that the Wright brothers aroused when they first announced their intention to fly. But what about after they had already flown? In fact, for a full five years after Wilbur and Orville made their first successful flight at Kitty Hawk, the newspapers and the public were both firmly convinced that flying was not possible!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People also have a way of believing only in things they can see with their own eyes. Geologists tell us that only 3 percent of the earth&#39;s fresh water is on the surface in the form of rivers and lakes. The other 97 percent remains as a huge subterranean reservoir down below. During the last century in Artois, France, a hole was dug 2,000 feet into the ground, and from it a fountain of water rose 290 feet into the air, gushing forth 1 million gallons of water per day. The term </span><span class="c2">artesian</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is derived from the name </span><span class="c2">Artois</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The potentials of human personality are much the same&mdash;only 3 percent on the surface and 97 percent below. Training takes the 3 percent that is on the surface and utilizes it much more efficiently by imparting skills to improve performance. Education digs deep below the surface and taps the infinite reservoir below, so that the concealed potentials of the human personality can overflow onto the surface in rich, creative profusion, like the waters of an artesian spring.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Challenge</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A century ago managing a business was like running in a cross-country race. The most important qualities for success were endurance, persistence, and a willingness to work hard. Fifty years later the race had become a sprint. Life began to change more rapidly, and the speed of response became a major factor. Today managing a business is more like competing in the decathalon. Not one or a few but a very wide range and depth of capacities are needed even to enter the contest. It requires not only speed and endurance but also a multiplicity of skills and an infinite reservoir of energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Modern technology is unveiling new discoveries and improved inventions at a lightning pace. Products have become highly sophisticated. The time interval between the day a new technology is discovered and the day it becomes obsolete is shrinking rapidly. Labor is no longer the uneducated, unskilled, and unsophisticated resource measured only in numbers that it used to be. The supervisor and the plant manager are no longer mere assistants who execute the will and whims of the proprietor. The individual has become the single most important factor in the success of a business. The quality of the person counts first. Money is no longer the proprietor&#39;s. It comes from banks and bonds, investors and investment groups. It carries with it greater responsibilities and obligations. The public is no longer ignorant and uninformed. It is alert and aware. Companies are projected before the public eye in a hundred ways, and the image they cast determines their future, like the carefully chosen words and gestures of a presidential candidate during a nationally televised debate; only in this case, debate is perpetual, and every one of a company&#39;s acts is carefully screened by consumers, investors, employees, the government, and competitors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Gone forever are the days when a manager could afford to behave like a proprietor running a one-person show. Gone, too, are the days when hard work was sufficient even for survival. No company can meet today&#39;s demand for quality, service, speed, and efficiency unless all its systems are faultless, all its activities are smoothly coordinated, all levels of its structure are finely integrated, and all the requisite skills are present in the requisite measure. Gone are the days when a manager could just push or bluff along the path to success with lots of energy and a loud voice. Management today is a very sophisticated activity that requires comprehensive knowledge, superb skills, and precise execution&mdash;like a perfect score of 10 on the parallel bars.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the good old days, people learned a business by working as apprentices under experienced individuals or in established firms. Gradually they acquired whatever knowledge and skills of the trade their boss possessed or cared to teach them and in the course of time were upgraded to managerial positions or set out to establish their own business. For modern corporations the price of learning by experience is very high. Companies can no longer afford a long, slow learning process that provides managers with partial knowlege and incomplete training.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is no longer enough that the manager be strong, intelligent, and alert. The basic stuff of human personality has to be developed through higher and higher levels of general education, and the multiplicity of essential business skills has to be further refined and upgraded by constant and continuous training.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have already seen in Chapter 6 that there are a lot more skills and types of skills that contribute to making a business successful than many people and companies realize. Physical and technical skills are essential, but social, organizational, managerial, and psychological skills are equally essential or more so. There is also a great deal more to acquiring a skill than mere physical proficiency. True mastery involves in-depth knowledge of the process, principles, and rationale for each action. When this mastery is present, individual workers are far more interested, enthusiastic, and productive; and the organization is many times more efficient. Highly developed skills are absolutely indispensable for properly translating corporate values and goals into action. A company can be said to possess a high degree of skill only when its lowest-level workers have acquired essential elements of top-level executive skills and its highest-level managers have acquired an essential knowledge of the lowest-level skills for execution. This is the challenge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It may sound like a good theory of skills, but is it really possible for companies to practice it? The fact is that consciously or unconsciously, companies do practice it, and the most successful companies practice it very successfully. That is why they are so successful.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There may not be much debate about the possibility of imparting a very high level of physical and technical skills, because we have been doing it successfully in schools and in companies for many decades. But what about the higher-order skills&mdash;social, organizational, managerial, and psychological?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We refer to Professor Higgins&#39; second important lesson for companies: Any skill can be learned through proper training. The cultured behavior of an aristocrat is an expression of many highly refined skills acquired and developed by the upper classes over hundreds of years. Like any other skills, they can be learned by almost anyone who is willing to make the required effort and who has the proper guidance. It takes centuries to develop an aristocratic culture. Successful corporate cultures are built up in a few decades. If the behavior of an aristocrat can be acquired by training, why can&#39;t the behavior of successful companies be learned the same way? If a flower girl can be trained to acquire the social skills of the English nobility, is there any skill that cannot be taught?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Upward Corporate Mobility</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The greatest challenge before management is coping with the accelerating pace of changes in the world today. Some companies, like IBM, have accommodated to the pace by increasing the speed of growth within the company through continuous education and training. Another company that has accommodated to rapid change is Merck. A few decades ago the marketing of prescription drugs in the United States was almost as aggressive as any other commercial hard sell. Merck was one of the first to see that times were changing and that a purely commercial approach to marketing drugs would no longer suffice. Twenty years ago the company introduced what was then one of the most sophisticated training programs in the industry. Now it is the standard. The aim of the program was to upgrade drug marketing to the highest level of professional activity. This meant raising the technical competence of the professional representatives until they were on a par with that of the physicians, at least in specialized areas. It also involved refining their presentation and communication skills until the relationship between physician and representative became a free exchange of knowledge rather than a sales pitch. Finally, it required the adoption by the representatives of a standard of objectivity and integrity rarely associated with the art of selling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Merck&#39;s executive director of field administration explained the rationale for the training program this way:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Every company has access to the same computers. Our competitors all have access to the same textbooks on medicine. We have access to the same market research firms and the same everything. So how do we get a competitive edge? It is the quality of our people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Recruit the best and continuously train them to be better is Merck&#39;s formula for successful marketing in a highly competitive industry.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every Merck representative starts with a four-year college education as a minimum. Most new entrants have master&#39;s or pharmacist&#39;s degrees; a few even have Ph.D.&#39;s. New representatives spend 15 weeks in basic training before they make their first call and another 35 weeks under close supervision. After that an additional 50 hours a year of classroom training are mandatory. The company also encourages representatives to continue their formal education, and it pays their tuition fees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ralph Goodison came to Merck 20 years ago with a B.Sc. in economics and has since acquired two master&#39;s degrees. &quot;They encourage us to continue our education. When we stop learning, we stop growing. There is an atmosphere of growth here. If you take the time to become better, you are not only better for Merck but also for your family, your society. The sky is the limit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">While many drug firms still regard selling medicine as essentially a commercial activity, Merck has moved all the way to the other end of the spectrum&mdash;and all the way to the top of the industry, too.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">How Much Is Too Much?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every company believes that training is important. The real questions are: What should we train for? And how much training is enough? The answer to these questions is quite straightforward. </span><span class="c2">Train for absolutely everything without exception, and keep on training&mdash;because there is no such thing as too much</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the area of physical skills, Marriott&#39;s training covers every aspect of the job with a fine-tooth comb. The training system for a hotel limousine driver includes a study of the hotel property and surrounding area, defensive driving, vehicle maintenance, knowledge of the hotel staff, and guest relations. The drivers are made aware of how their slightest positive or negative action can influence repeat business favorably or unfavorably, so they realize the full importance of their job and feel a sense of responsibility.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the area of interpersonal skills, Hertz has established a comprehensive training program to ensure that it stays No. 1 by providing the best customer service in the rent-a-car industry. In earlier years the company sometimes had customer-service representatives working at its counters who had not even gone through new-hire training; but not anymore. Hertz has recognized that every employee who comes in contact with the customer is a potential salesperson for the company and must be thoroughly trained. Shirley Gunzer, director of training and communications, says, &quot;Top management really understands the value of training.&quot; Front-counter personnel now receive a total of four weeks of orientation and training. Approximately half of it focuses on interpersonal skills. They are taught to project a cheerful, positive image; to listen carefully to the customer; to deal with facts rather than emotions; to understand the customer&#39;s point of view; and to meet the customer&#39;s unexpressed needs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most comprehensive training program that we came across for interpersonal skills was at Northwestern Mutual, where maintaining the highest possible level of teamwork and internal harmony is a core value of the company. For the last 15 years, Northwestern Mutual has periodically conducted confidential surveys of all personnel to determine employees&#39; perceptions and satisfactions concerning their bosses, peers, and work teams; from these perceptions it is possible to identify areas where each manager and work team can improve performance or acquire new skills. The survey results are translated for managers into a &quot;training needs analysis.&quot; The training programs emphasize skills in communication, listening, empathy, supportiveness, goal setting, coordination, team building, and resolution of conflicts between managers and subordinates. There are also special training programs, such as the one to help customer-service representatives deal with irate customers on the phone. Wherever a skill is lacking or can be improved, Northwestern Mutual trains to provide it.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Making Mr. Watsons</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In earlier centuries people commonly believed that the qualities of a successful leader were entirely innate and unique to the individual. But as we have come to understand the nature of human personality better, we have realized that many attributes of successful individuals&mdash;barring the rare genius like Einstein or the leader of superhuman power like Napoleon&mdash;are actually skills that they acquired by virtue of their upbringing, training, and experience. We have also recognized that these skills can be learned by almost anyone through proper training.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This is as true in the field of business as it is in war and politics. The aura of mystery and romance that surrounded the builders of the first industrial empires has given way to one of understanding and objective appraisal. There was nothing unique about the ability of individuals like Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, Sloan, or Vail&mdash;except perhaps their dedication to the goals they pursued, in some cases to the exclusion of all other considerations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Today there are other individuals, who are virtually unknown to the public, running enterprises far bigger than those commanded by any of the early industrialists. How many Americans even know the names of the CEOs of Exxon Corporation, GM, Mobil Corporation, Ford, and IBM? Of course, none of these individuals was a founder or empire builder. But that is not the only reason for their relative anonymity. The mystique surrounding the earlier leaders of business has been shattered. The veil has been lifted. We have discovered that success in business is very much a matter of skills&mdash;skills that can be taught.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This is the rationale for the entire management-development program at IBM, which has produced a series of new leaders from the ranks to direct the fortunes of a $40 billion business. When Frank Cary became president at the time of the retirement of Tom Watson, Jr., in 1971, Cary &quot;seemed the very model of faceless bureaucrat so often found in the executive suites of major bureaucrat firms.&hellip;He tended to blend in with his background rather than to impress people by force of intellect or imagination.&quot; In short, he was what former employees described as &quot;a perfect IBM product,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt114" id="ftnt_ref114">[114]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;trained through the system and equipped with all the skills required to direct it. John Opel, who joined IBM in 1949 and succeeded Cary as chairman, considers himself an interchangeable part of the company. &quot;I&#39;m a product of the culture of IBM, of the way we do things.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt115" id="ftnt_ref115">[115]</a></sup><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Cary and Opel may be outstanding managers, but they are also outstanding products of a training system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Looking to the time when Bill Marriott, Jr., steps down as CEO, Marriott has established a management-development program to prepare other executives to take over. The program covers a wide range of organizational, managerial, and leadership skills, including time management; delegation of responsibility; and, most interesting of all, problem solving.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Critical Skill</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The ability to solve problems is one skill that many managers believe cannot be transmitted through training. Actually, there is a process or technique to problem solving that most managers follow unconsciously but that can be made conscious, systematized, and taught to others. In almost all cases, a solution can be found by viewing a problem in its wider context, tracing the problem to its original source, and making a firm commitment to resolve the problem at all costs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Bill Marriott, Jr., related an incident in which he went into a Marriott hotel restaurant and found the service unsatisfactory. Instead of immediately calling over the manager to demand greater discipline, he called over a waitress to hear about the problem from her point of view. She explained that the hotel received many foreign guests who are used to a system in which tips are included in the bill, so the waiters and waitresses did not earn much on tips and the good ones quickly left. On hearing this explanation, Marriott instructed the manager to raise the salaries of the staff, and the problem was solved. He explained:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">The manager of the hotel had been casting about for several months to get better service, and he never bothered to ask the people that were on the line. I&#39;m sure that this happens a lot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Marriott&#39;s problem at the hotel was a small one. Iacocca&#39;s problem at Chrysler was gargantuan. But the process of arriving at a solution was the same. As Iacocca soon discovered, the problem boiled down to the fact that &quot;everybody at Chrysler was doing something he was not trained for.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt116" id="ftnt_ref116">[116]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The design engineers, for instance, were telling the production people what to produce and the marketing people what to sell.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The problem could be traced back to the fact that the company&#39;s founder, Walter Chrysler, was a talented engineer who gave a greater emphasis to innovative engineering than to marketing. As a result, a bias developed within the corporation in favor of the engineering department, which became the most powerful and dictated policy to the production and marketing people. The company was turned inward and lost contact with the needs of the market. Iacocca took one look at what was going on and saw the cause of the problem. Chrysler was producing what the engineers designed, not what the market desired. The solution followed naturally: Find out what the customer wants and make it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There was a lot of good common sense in what Iacocca did at Chrysler, but not much genius. Problems are created by ordinary people. They can be solved by ordinary people, too. What Iacocca did at Chrysler can be taught to anyone through proper training.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Whatever Happened to Eliza?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In George Bernard Shaw&#39;s original British play </span><span class="c2">Pygmalion</span><span class="c3">, Eliza eventually ends up married to Freddy, whose family has fallen from the heights of aristocracy into the depths of poverty. In Lerner and Loewe&#39;s American version, </span><span class="c2">My Fair Lady</span><span class="c3">, she decides to stay on with Higgins in the lingering hope of marrying him someday. Shaw was wise enough to know that Higgins&mdash;an aristocrat, the son of an affectionate mother, and a confirmed bachelor&mdash;would never marry a flower girl, no matter how pretty she looked or how sweetly she spoke. He also knew that no bright girl like Eliza would prefer spinsterhood with a gruff bachelor to marriage with a doting young man.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.3eybt65okw5l"><span class="c3">But Lerner and Loewe understood far better the power of education and training. Eliza had discovered that it was possible to radically transform her appearance and behavior with a little help from a good teacher. Having drunk from the waters of the artesian spring, she undoubtedly hoped that over time the same power could be used to transform a confirmed bachelor into an affectionate husband. Considering the power of the instrument and the intensity of Eliza&#39;s commitment to the goal, we tend to think she was right&mdash;as America has proved right about education.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 8 - Building Up the Corporate Body</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is said that the true greatness of a poet lies in the capacity to express a great inspiration in simple, ordinary language. There is a story about an Englishwoman who attended a literature course in her later life to make up for a complete lack of childhood education. When she read Shakespeare for the first time, she remarked: &quot;This writer takes all the most common English phrases and stuffs them into his books.&quot; The woman did not realize that it was Shakespeare who created all those common phrases. Shakespeare possessed the capacity to express his profound insights about human nature and life in vivid phrases that have enriched the everyday English language and come to be taken for granted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The true greatness of a corporation is measured in the same way&mdash;by the capacity to express its highest values in the smallest physical details and most ordinary, routine acts of daily life, which everyone takes for granted. A small, thoughtful innovation on the dashboard of your car, a typewriter that operates silently without vibration or hesitation, a computer instruction manual that is very simple and easy to understand, spotless rest rooms in a crowded public building, a telephone that is answered with a friendly voice on the first ring&mdash;these are the finer expressions of the art of corporate excellence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You can tell a lot about an individual&#39;s personality and character from his or her appearance or smallest act, if only you are perceptive enough to observe carefully. When Sherlock Holmes was first introduced to Dr. Watson, he astonished Watson by discerning his profession and his recent tour of military duty in Afghanistan from Watson&#39;s speech, clothes, and gestures.</span></p><a id="id.75nlvuzfdyu9"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The perceptive person can learn just as much about a company by observing the appearance of its facilities, the quality of its products or services, and the way it handles materials, money, and machines. Of course, these material things, which constitute the physical body of a corporation, represent only a small part of what a company really is. (See Figure 5.) Behind these things, controlling them and expressing itself through them, is the personality of a living organization. The more developed and integrated that personality is, the more fully and clearly its values will be expressed in the most mundane material aspects of its existence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 295.00px; height: 294.07px;"><img alt="The role of the corporate body in the corporate personality" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 295.00px; height: 294.07px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><a id="id.t6wbqko4ddfv"></a></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c41">Figure 5 &nbsp;The role of the corporate body in the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The health and performance of the corporate body&mdash;like those of human body&mdash;depend very much on the way they are cultured and used or neglected and abused. Hygiene is as important to the proper functioning of an office or a factory as it is to the health of a person. Exercise and proper diet are as essential to the performance of equipment and machinery as they are to the organs of the human body. The vitality of both the person and the company depend on the proper selection and absorption of the right qualities and quantities of raw materials and the proper elimination of wastes. The quality of a product and service depends as much on these things as the quality of a person&#39;s life and actions.

One of Levi Strauss&#39; central beliefs is that &quot;the well-being of the company and the well-being of its people are one and the same.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt118" id="ftnt_ref118">[118]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For almost 70 years Levi Strauss lived in a warm, cozy, four-story building on Battery Street in downtown San Francisco, where it moved after the 1906 earthquake destroyed its previous residence. But rapid growth in the 1960s strained the facility to the bursting point, so in 1973 the company moved to a modern high rise at the Embarcadero Center. Levi Strauss employees were stationed on the lower floors and executives on the twenty-eighth floor, which was accessed by different elevators. Suddenly, executives and subordinates were no longer meeting each other in the halls. People started complaining of a cold, isolated feeling in their glass-enclosed cubicles. A survey of employees revealed that the family feeling and close interpersonal relations were suffering.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Even though the lease had another 13 years to run, the company decided to build its own headquarters complex on an eight-acre site at the foot of Telegraph Hill overlooking San Francisco Bay. Levi Strauss&#39; new home consists of five red brick buildings, which blend into the slope of the hill behind. When you enter Levi Strauss&#39; offices, you have the feeling you are really in a home. On every floor there are three or four very large open-area lounges with cushioned chairs, couches, and kitchenettes, which cover a total area of about 5,000 square feet. Fifty percent of the office space is open, and half of the window exposure is in open areas. In addition, there are dozens of open-air balconies, a 7,000-square-foot health club, and a park. One woman, who was sitting on the lawn eating her lunch, summed up the attitude of employees toward the new offices: &quot;This is mine!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What was the price the company paid for this luxury? First, Levi Strauss got a building that was 10 percent more efficient in terms of usable office space than the one at Embarcadero. Second, it got higher productivity. Howard Friedman, consulting architect for the company, said: &quot;There&#39;s no question. It&#39;s very easy arithmetic. There is less employee turnover. The waiting list is tremendous. That&#39;s a key. If you reduce your turnover, you increase your productivity.&quot; Friedman says that Levi Strauss has made the same effort to humanize its 50 factories around the country, through selection of attractive rural settings; comfortable lighting; good acoustics; air conditioning; pleasant eating and lounge areas; and personal, domestic-type toilets.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In contrast to Levi Strauss&#39; relaxed, casual, people-oriented atmosphere, the headquarters of Deere in Moline, Illinois, radiates an aura of quality and precision engineering, two of the company&#39;s dominant corporate values. Levi Strauss shunned the steel-and-glass look; Deere consciously adopted it to express values of simplicity, functional efficiency, cleanliness, endurance, and strength. The building has been called the &quot;Versailles of the cornfields&quot; and is generally considered the best piece of corporate architecture in the country.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Friedman says that Deere&#39;s building reflects the belief that &quot;people should work in surroundings that have the same care and attention to design that they give to the products they make and that the character of the place you work [in] is an absolute reflection of the caliber and quality of the product.&quot; Deere applies the same principle to its manufacturing plants, even the traditionally smoke-and soot-filled foundries. According to an article in </span><span class="c2">The Boston Globe Magazine</span><span class="c3">, &quot;Deere may run the only foundries in North America with not even a cigarette butt on the floor.&hellip;At Deere, the emphasis on a quality environment for the workers is almost fanatic.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt119" id="ftnt_ref119">[119]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Levi Strauss and Deere mean what they say. They carry their highest values down to the most material level.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Good Housekeeping</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Anyone familiar with the history of the leather industry knows that tanneries are as infamous for their dirt and gloom as foundries are for their smoke and dust, especially the tanneries of central Europe 50 years ago. But not all the tanneries. Tomas Bata was so obsessed with cleanliness that he had all his workers wearing clean shirts every day, installed showers, and insisted that every machine and window be washed once a week. One day he walked through one of his tanneries wearing white gloves and rubbing the black machinery as he passed by. After seeing the soot on his gloves, he ordered that all the machinery should thereafter be painted white. He instituted a system for keeping all his factories so clean that it was difficult to find a single piece of wastepaper on the miles of pavement. Even the power plant that he installed before 1911 was kept spotlessly clean. A half-century later his son Thomas explained why: &quot;Cleanliness is something that we have always valued. It maintains a certain discipline in assuring a quality attitude. If you create a clean environment, people react differently. It&#39;s something we strive for.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What is so special about cleanliness? Nothing except that the most successful companies seem to take it very seriously and many others just take it for granted. Contrast Bata&#39;s factories 50 years ago with this American factory:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">[There is] garbage throughout the plant, since very few employees ever get in the habit of using the garbage barrels provided for their use.&hellip;Water and oil on the floor will always be a problem in plants. These items were not considered when equipment installations were made; of course there is no excuse for stock on the floor, disorderly stock arrangement, or miscellaneous items lying all over the place.&hellip;Every time we expected a visit from one of the top officers we spent a minimum of $20,000 to dress up the plant.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt120" id="ftnt_ref120">[120]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This description by a Chrysler plant supervisor in the early 1970s contrasts dramatically with </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&#39;s description of IBM&#39;s &quot;wholly immaculate factories&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt121" id="ftnt_ref121">[121]</a></sup><span class="c3">&mdash;in 1940! It is a funny thing how cleanliness and prosperity seem to go together. Cleanliness has a power.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a corporate value, cleanliness is closely linked with other values. At Anheuser-Busch, Inc. cleanliness is absolutely essential for maintaining the highest-quality beer. &quot;I couldn&#39;t impress upon you enough the importance of cleanliness,&quot; says Jerry Ritter, corporate vice-president of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. &quot;Cleanliness is probably the most important expression of what you think of yourself, what you think about your product, and what you say to other people. This company has had that attitude from the very beginning. It runs throughout the company. It starts at the top and goes right through the rest of the organization.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Du Pont cleanliness is closely linked to safety. &quot;You can&#39;t have one without the other,&quot; says John Page. It is also a key value at General Mills. Gene Sailer, director of manufacturing in the Package Food Operations Division, says, &quot;If you walk through an environment where you feel good&mdash;because the parking lot is clean, the yards are clean, the maintenance shops are orderly (we like to say there should be no dust in the air!)&mdash;it really sets the tone for the work. It&#39;s a signal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We all associate cleanliness with the value of customer service, so it is not surprising to learn that cleanliness is a high priority in Marriott&#39;s hotel lobbies, guest rooms, and restaurants. But Joe Uhl, assistant office manager at a Marriott hotel, says: &quot;The whole hotel, even behind the scenes in the back offices, in the storerooms&mdash;everything has to be clean.&quot; Why is cleanliness important in places where the customer never goes? Bill Marriott, Jr., says: &quot;It&#39;s an indicator of commitment, an indicator of being on top of your job&mdash;you know, the Marine Corps policy of polishing your shoes. It&#39;s spit and polish. It&#39;s indicative of trying to do a good job. We look under the beds. We look in the corners. We look at the back lot.&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The power of cleanliness is best illustrated by instances in which it is not expected at all. Cleanliness was never traditionally associated with low-priced-fast-food restaurants until McDonald&#39;s made it one of the firm&#39;s primary corporate values. McDonald&#39;s clean restaurants convey what no amount of advertising can; namely, that &quot;McDonald&#39;s food is really clean and sanitary and healthy&mdash;even for the middle class!&quot; Walt Disney Productions did the same thing for amusement parks, making Disneyland into even an upper-class attraction. The clean environment of the park tells customers that they are visiting a respectable, acceptable, wholesome place just like home.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Better Maintenance</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everything in this world responds to attention. Recognition of abilities and development of talents are forms of attention to people; cleanliness and proper maintenance are expressions of attention to machines. In </span><span class="c2">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</span><span class="c3">, Robert Pirsig writes about the personality of machines and relates how they, like people, respond to attention: &quot;Each machine has its own, unique personality.&hellip;The new ones start out as good-looking strangers and, depending on how they are treated, degenerate rapidly into bad-acting grouches or even cripples, or else turn into healthy, good-natured, long-lasting friends.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt122" id="ftnt_ref122">[122]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Of course, all American companies know the importance of proper attention to machinery. Well, judging from this description of a Chrysler plant 15 years ago, perhaps not quite all:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Much of the equipment was in need of replacement and another large percentage of it in need of repair.&hellip;It was a constant battle to try to stop the scrap.&hellip;Failure to keep equipment in good operating condition also caused another big expensive waste of manpower and performance&mdash;repairs were excessive. When the repair bank is high, the scrap rate is high. We worked night and day to get defective material repaired. We were well aware that to stop defective material at the source was the real solution to reduce the repair bank. It is very serious in many ways: one, it created excessive inventory that ran into millions of dollars; two, extra manpower required to repair the defective material cost millions of dollars. The equipment did not get bad overnight; we had built 12 million engines on this equipment. </span><span class="c2">We had no preventive maintenance program</span><span class="c3">. [Emphasis added.]</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt123" id="ftnt_ref123">[123]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The realization of high corporate values and goals requires the support of a firm physical foundation. Proper maintenance of equipment is one essential component. Like cleanliness, the value of maintenance is intimately related to other corporate values. At Anheuser-Busch, Inc. and General Mills, machinery maintenance is an integral part of quality control. As one executive at the beer manufacturer said: &quot;The more shutdowns you have, the more quality-maintenance problems you have. We&#39;d like to have a minimum number of unscheduled, unplanned shutdowns.&quot; General Mills is installing a computerized preventive-maintenance program so it can keep more accurate track of all the moving parts in its plants&mdash;with a standard part-numbering system! Good preventive maintenance is essential not only for quality but for maintaining punctuality on production schedules. Gene Sailer, of General Mills, says: &quot;A key to reliability of the system is preventive maintenance. A good preventive-maintenance program is worth 5 to 10 percent in terms of the reliability of the systems.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Du Pont good maintenance is essential for realizing the corporate value (we&#39;re sure you know by now). Safety is also a core value at Delta, and Delta&#39;s preventive-maintenance program is unsurpassed in the industry. Delta&#39;s senior vice-president for technical operations, Don Hettermann, tells his maintenance crew that &quot;safety is every-body&#39;s business, not just the inspector or the foreman, but everyone&#39;s.&quot; Speaking of reliability, Delta&#39;s mechanical-dispatch reliability is 99.49 percent&mdash;that is the percentage of flights that are not subject to any delay because of maintenance problems. Delta defines a delay as anything more than one minute, whereas some airlines consider a flight delayed only after 15 minutes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Good maintenance is also closely connected with good customer service at Delta. It is an important reason why Delta has had the best consumer-complaint record among the major U.S. airlines in all but one of the last 14 years&mdash;it finished a close second in 1973&mdash;and usually has one-third to one-tenth as many complaints per 100,000 passengers as other carriers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Good Dining</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is well known that the quality of food a person eats is highly correlated with life expectancy and resistance to disease. A similar relationship exists between the raw materials that a company consumes and its long-term financial health. Find a company in financial difficulties and you are likely to find one that is ordering materials it does not require, paying too much for what it orders, accepting defective materials or materials of the wrong specifications or materials it has not even ordered, or perhaps all of these together. When there is a shortage of raw materials or a shortage of funds to purchase them, it is usually a signal that raw materials are being wasted or not utilized as efficiently as they should be.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The problem of high inventory costs has plagued manufacturers ever since the early days of mass production. Henry Ford was the first to devise an efficient solution by creating a moving inventory system. The idea was to project the precise timing of the assembly-line operation and then schedule procurement of raw materials to conform to that schedule, so that there was no need to store them. GM improved on Ford&#39;s system by forcing suppliers to conform to production schedules at their own risk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination of purchasing and production has been lifted to the status of a fine art by the Japanese, with the &quot;just in time&quot; inventory system. Materials and components are ordered to arrive at precisely the time they are required for production, thereby reducing inventory costs to an absolute minimum.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Controlling inventory to minimize production costs sounds easy enough. But to raise the value of cost efficiency through the &quot;just in time&quot; system requires raising performance throughout the corporation, from top to bottom. Planning, marketing, purchasing, and production systems all must be refined and precisely coordinated. Intel introduced the system in 1982. Before that, the firm used to reschedule production runs and orders to vendors every time it got a new order from a customer. Now it projects future orders and sticks to the production schedule. Vendors have become far more reliable and offer Intel lower prices because its orders are reliable. In the process, Intel has reduced its inventory levels by 40 percent, and its own production reliability has increased from 80 percent to 99 percent. Good digestion requires some thought.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Thing Itself</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">You can learn a lot about a company from its products, too. People sometimes talk about quality as if it were something that is actually determined on the factory floor, but that is no more true of quality than of profitability. Quality is not something produced by quality circles. Quality is a value. Achieving it depends on the company&#39;s total commitment to that value, the strength of its will, the establishment of clear standards, the creation of effective systems, the acquisition of precision skills, the design of appropriate production facilities, the proper maintenance of machinery, the purchase of the right materials, the coordination and integration of these factors, and above all, a corporate attitude at all levels of the company like that expressed by Jerry Ritter of Anheuser-Busch: &quot;The quality of our product is absolutely the ultimate and the No. 1 thought in our minds at all times.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Making quality the No. 1 priority is not quite so simple as it may sound. To really put the importance of the product or service above the importance of profits requires an enormous commitment by management that will be tested every day and can never withstand the pressure to compromise unless quality really is more important to the company than money. As Peters and Waterman discovered in their study of excellent companies, &quot;Profit is a natural by-product of doing something well, not an end in itself.&hellip;&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt124" id="ftnt_ref124">[124]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In each company we visited, there were values that were placed far above the value of money&mdash;in practice as well as in principle. At Merck quality and integrity come first. Quality begins with research. As former Chairman John Horan described Merck&#39;s guiding belief: &quot;If you produce something worthwhile, money will follow.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt125" id="ftnt_ref125">[125]</a></sup><span class="c3">Merck&#39;s strategy has been to attract top-notch research scientists from the universities and give them a wide latitude of freedom to pursue every lead, regardless of its potential for profit. In the 1940s Merck invested $20 million on an eight-year research project to find a cure for Addison&#39;s disease, knowing full well that the drug could never repay the investment. But what researchers actually discovered was cortisone, a revolutionary breakthrough for the treatment of arthritis. This discovery, together with the synthesis of vitamin B</span><span class="c41 c64">12</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and streptomycin, launched Merck on its way to the top. Merck invests nearly twice as much on research as the average company in the industry&mdash;11 percent of sales versus 6.7 percent for the industry in 1983 and a total of $400 million in 1984. For Merck, quality research comes first; the rest follows naturally.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The quality of a product consists of several components: the quality of the materials used to make it, the quality of the workmanship, and the quality of the technology. Whenever a new product comes out on the market, the Japanese practice is to buy one, call all the experts to gather around, and try to make as many tiny improvements on the original as possible. By the time they are finished, the improved version far surpasses the original. That is the infinite potential of technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The quality of almost every product can be improved 100 percent by this procedure, especially when those who try to refine it were not involved in the original development and can take a completely fresh approach. Although commercial custom condones such practices and law does not always prohibit them, the act of imitating another&#39;s invention, in which enormous investment has been made in research and development, is fundamentally dishonest. It may be a successful strategy for short-term growth, but not for enduring success. American business is founded on the values of creativity and individual initiative, not imitation. Even if we could, we should not imitate the Japanese in this regard&mdash;it would kill our creative impulse. What we can do to protect ourselves is to introduce a similar practice within our own companies to improve our own technologies&mdash;a department of R, D, &amp; I (research, development, and innovation)&mdash;bringing in outside experts to provide fresh perspectives and new ideas before the Japanese do.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Weighing In</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a physical asset, money constitutes part of the corporate body, and, like the other parts, it responds to proper attention. Attention to money is given in the form of proper accounting. Accounting is a system to help the manager understand his or her operations better. When properly used, it is the most effective tool for monitoring corporate performance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the 1860s the Pennsylvania Railroad was the largest business operation in the world, and it pioneered many of the management techniques that have since become commonplace. As the first of the big publicly owned enterprises in the United States, the railroads were answerable to a large number of investors, who had the right to know exactly how the firm spent their money. The Penn was the first to introduce modern principles of cost accounting and did it so effectively that a stockholders&#39; committee marveled to find that &quot;a charge or entry of a day&#39;s labor, of the purchase of a keg of nails, of the largest order goes through such a system of checks and audits as to make fraud almost an impossibility.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt126" id="ftnt_ref126">[126]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Cost accounting enabled the Penn to accurately measure its cost on each and every operation and pinpoint precisely which ones made money and which ones did not. It also made possible cost-based pricing, to assure a profit on every rate it fixed. This apparently mundane achievement was quite a feat for a huge business, at a time when many companies had no idea of whether they were earning or losing until they closed the accounts at the end of the year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Andrew Carnegie learned cost accounting and other managerial techniques as a superintendent for the Penn and went on to apply them even more effectively at the Carnegie Steel Company, forerunner of the United States Steel Corporation. When he founded his company, he was surprised to learn that none of the steel companies was in the habit of calculating the costs of each production process. Carnegie introduced a comprehensive accounting system to accurately measure the cost of each and every process. This system enabled him to eliminate inefficient processes, rationally evaluate alternatives, replace less efficient equipment, even if it were newly purchased, and thereby bring down his production costs to the lowest level in the world&mdash;from $56 per ton in 1872 to $11.50 per ton by 1900.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Long after Carnegie had retired, cost accounting remained a rare phenomenon. Henry Ford despised accounting as &quot;a seedy offshoot of the banking conspiracy&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt127" id="ftnt_ref127">[127]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;and refused to let accountants touch the company&#39;s books. Once he sent a nocturnal raiding party to clear out the offices of a new accounting department, which his son Edsel had installed in his absence. Until Ford&#39;s retirement in 1945, no one in the company knew the cost of anything it made or did or even whether the company made a profit or loss the previous year.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Of course, American business has come a long way since Henry Ford, hasn&#39;t it? Well, shortly after taking up his new job, Iacocca discovered that &quot;Chrysler had no overall system of financial controls. To make matters worse, nobody in the whole place seemed to fully understand what was going on when it came to financial planning and projecting. Even the most rudimentary questions were impossible for them to answer.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt128" id="ftnt_ref128">[128]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Each company can judge for itself whether Chrysler is an exceptional case or not.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The real issue is not whether a company maintains cost accounts but the extent to which these accounts accurately reflect and precisely reveal actual activities at the lowest level of operations. Even today many corporations are not able to break down their numbers to declare precisely how much money each activity, operation, product, or service is earning or losing. Aggregate lump-sum figures provide only a general impression of overall performance. Accounting becomes a powerful and sensitive instrument only when it reflects the actual cost of each separate activity. To do so, accounting systems must be integrated with the production process and based on detailed records of what actually takes place in the factory, store, or office.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sears is probably one of the best-controlled companies in the United States. It employs a very sophisticated cost-accounting system that is sensitive to minute changes in the performance of each individual department of every store. Standards have been fixed for virtually every item of expenditure, such as stationery supplies per thousand sales transactions, the number of minutes required by the accounting department to balance a cash-register account, cleaning supplies per 1,000 square feet, and so on. The company is constantly working to bring down every cost, even the most routine. In 1984 the cost of janitorial supplies was projected to decrease by 5 percent due to standardization of the products used.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The numbers on a balance sheet are most frequently employed to understand a company&#39;s profitability; but they lend themselves to many other uses. More precisely than any other factor, money reflects the amount of energy expended on a product or activity, the direction the company is moving in, and the level of employee enthusiasm. When carefully studied, these figures can reveal at a very early stage of production, or even during the planning phase, whether a product will generate a profit or a loss. If one knows all that numbers can reveal, the soundness of a decision can be tested in no time by casting it into monetary figures. There is no process, no activity, no direction, no result of a company that cannot be revealed by the numbers, provided that the policy, principles, and practices of accounting are properly adapted and organized.</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Geneen describes the power of numbers quite dramatically:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">Anyone in business, if he sets up the proper kinds of controls&mdash;controls that tell him when any segment of his company is not doing what he expected, and tell him this promptly enough and in enough detail so that he can go back behind the numbers and analyze precisely where it is that he has to take action&mdash;then he (or anyone else not mentally incompetent) could run a progressive, profitable, and growth-oriented company. That&#39;s what a good set of numbers will do for you.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt129" id="ftnt_ref129">[129]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Vital Signs</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The true health of the human body is not measured by its size, strength, and outer appearance, but by certain vital signs that are indicators of the harmonious and efficient functioning of the organs and systems inside and even of the psychological condition of the individual. The sound of the heartbeat, color of the cheeks, and clarity of the eyes tell a physician much more about a person than height and weight. The vital signs of health are the same for all, independent of age and size. A healthy six-month-old infant and a healthy grandmother both have a body temperature of 98.6</span><span class="c8">&deg;</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;F.&mdash;it does not vary even a little this way or that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same is true of companies as well. There are vital signs of corporate health, which are independent of a company&#39;s size and financial strength and more accurately reflect its vitality. A company that regards an open file drawer as a safety hazard, a flight that leaves a minute behind schedule as late, a room with a single piece of paper on the floor as filthy, the number of square feet a janitor cleans as a crucial aspect of productivity, an excessive consumption of paper clips as a cause for concern, a phone call answered on the first ring and a letter replied to on the same day as minimum standards of courtesy, and a machine that starts to murmur a little as an urgent case for repair&mdash;that company, regardless of its size, shows the vital signs of excellent health, because its values are actually real. And any company that does not exhibit these signs&mdash;regardless of its size&mdash;certainly has scope to improve its health.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Bodybuilding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">No one can afford to ignore health. The survival and good health of the body is the essential condition for achievement or enjoyment. But mere physical health is not the be-all and end-all of life. Those who focus an inordinate attention on muscle building and controlled nutrition forget that these are only the means for living and not the aim of life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same is true for a company. Corporate bodybuilding is a means to an end, not an end in itself. In the 1920s Ford amassed a huge corporate body, with $700 million in surplus cash, only to come to the brink of bankruptcy a decade later&mdash;because the firm forgot that the corporate body is only the most external form of something living, which is inside.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.tn9ngrvemiri"><span class="c3">The ultimate value of an organization cannot be measured by its size, the number of buildings it owns, the number of products it makes, or even the wealth it accumulates. The achievements of great individuals, great institutions, and great nations are not measured in these terms. The first duty of a company is to survive, as Drucker said; and for that, profits are essential. But that is only its first duty, not its ultimate goal. We must look beyond the outer physical form for that higher purpose.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 9 - Harmony Within</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Remember those old, imported European films with the dubbed-in English words that were a fraction of a second out of synchronization with the picture? That infinitesimal error in timing prevented you from losing yourself in the story and gave even the finest acting an air of awkwardness or unreality. Imagine what the effect would be if the delay were a minute or two instead of a second. You would hear people still talking to each other after one of them had already walked out the door. You would hear the bad guy challenging the hero to draw after watching the villain fall dead on the dusty main street. The awkward and unreal would become hilarious and absurd. That is the importance of harmony between words and acts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Suppose a company performs like an unsynchronized film, saying one thing and doing another&mdash;shipping orders after their cancellation dates, purchasing parts for discontinued production models, introducing a technology or fashion after it has already become outdated in the market, paying workers overtime one week and laying them off the next and paying them overtime again the third, borrowing money from the bank at high interest for one division while another division of the same company is depositing its excess funds at low interest, setting priorities that are misinterpreted and executed in reverse at lower levels, adopting high corporate values that are negated in practice by unhelpful attitudes among staff, and so on. An impartial observer of these things is not likely to be very amused. Yet all of these expressions of disharmony in an organization are much more common these days than an unsynchronized film.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Operational Harmony&mdash;Coordination</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Harmony is essential to all life, whether it be the life of an organism or the life of an organization. The most basic form of physical harmony, what we call coordination, is dramatically exemplified by the routine functioning of the human body. At every moment the body maintains a very delicate balance and precise equilibrium between the intake of oxygen, beating of the heart, flow of blood, digestion of food, excitation of nerves, exertion of muscles, functioning of organs, secretion of hormones, and maintenance of constant body temperature. If this harmony of the body is even slightly disturbed, it means big trouble.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the operational level, companies function very much like the human body. They expend an enormous amount of energy in a steady stream just to maintain routine activities like purchasing, production, storage, distribution, marketing, maintenance, recruitment, and training. At every moment an organization has to preserve the delicate balance between all of these simultaneous activities. The maximum efficiency of an organization is achieved when all its parts function in smooth harmony with one another.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">An organization is a complex matrix of interdependent activities. If purchasing slackens, production slows. If sales flag, inventories rise. If collections fall behind, cash flow suffers. If recruitment or training is inadequate, expansion is retarded. A disequilibrium between any of these functions can cause serious, sometimes irreparable, harm to the health of the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination is physical harmony in the horizontal dimension between activities, systems, and departments at the same level of the organization. Integration is physical harmony in the vertical dimension between activities, systems, and departments at higher and lower levels of the organization. Coordination and integration are basic organizational values, without which other values like quality, efficiency, profitability, and service cannot be achieved. Even the simple act of serving hamburgers at McDonald&#39;s requires precise coordination among systems for taking orders, cooking, serving, receiving payments, and cleaning equipment. These systems must also be integrated with other systems for purchasing supplies, recruiting staff, training, and facilities maintenance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Companies usually establish coordination and integration at key points that are essential for their functioning. But there are many other areas of interaction where these values are frequently lacking. A retired Chrysler plant supervisor related an incident that occurred when he was supervising assembly operations at a Chrysler engine plant. The metal-stamping department always liked to run the highest-priced jobs, regardless of conditions in other departments. On one occasion the stamp plant kept running front fenders even though the metal-finishing department had run out of room to store them and had requested the stamp plant to stop. To cope with the onslaught, metal-finishing personnel were pitching the fenders onto a ten-foot-high pile and damaging them in the process.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This incident, which occurred in the early 1950s, might be dismissed as an isolated occurrence; but another description of Chrysler 25 years later suggests that it was not. When Iacocca arrived at Chrysler, he found that</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">the company consisted of a bunch of little duchies&hellip;a bunch of mini-empires, with nobody giving a damn about what anyone else was doing&hellip;thirty-five vice-presidents, each with his own turf. There was no real committee setup, no cement in the organization chart, no system of meetings to get people talking to each other. I couldn&#39;t believe, for example, that the guy running the engineering department wasn&#39;t in constant touch with his counterpart in manufacturing. But that&#39;s how it was. Everybody worked independently.&hellip;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt130" id="ftnt_ref130">[130]</a></sup></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Tuning Up the Company</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many companies are like a box containing all the parts of an unassembled watch. They have all the resources required for successful operations&mdash;talented people, a fine product, sufficient capital, a good market&mdash;yet somehow they are not able to put it all together and make it run properly. Other companies are like a watch that has been clumsily assembled by an amateur. All its parts are grinding and grating on each other. There is some rough working order, but things are constantly stopping, going wrong, breaking down. Then there are companies that function like a precision-made, well-lubricated watch. All the components are in precisely the right relationship to one another, and movements between them are perfectly synchronized, frictionless, and smooth. These companies have achieved harmony at the operational level.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At about the same time Chrysler&#39;s stamp and metal-working departments were fighting over fenders, IBM introduced coordination between its engineering and production departments to facilitate the development of one of its first electronic computers. This coordination resulted in faster and cheaper development of a better-quality product and thereafter became a basic operating principle at IBM.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When John Huck joined Merck as director of marketing in 1958, the company was dominated by a powerful research division. Research developed new products and gave them to the marketing division to sell, in much the same way Chrysler&#39;s engineering department used to design new-model cars. At that time, the research and development staff used to call meetings to present new products to the marketing division. These meetings marked the first time that marketing people were exposed to these products or had an opportunity to comment on them. The relationship was all one way. There was no coordination between divisions at an early stage of product development.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Soon after Huck&#39;s arrival, a serious effort was made to rectify the imbalance. A joint research-marketing committee system was established to coordinate work even during the research phase. Product managers began to mingle with researchers on the once-forbidden terrain of the laboratories. One good example of a product that benefited by the improved working relationship between research and marketing was a new antidepressant drug with significantly better characteristics than the competition. This drug soon became number one in its field.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Increased harmony at the physical level through coordination not only raised productivity within the company; it evoked a response from the market as well. When Merck launched its effort to coordinate, it ranked among the second half-dozen drug companies in the United States. By the time the move for internal coordination was complete, Merck was a rising star in the industry. As Huck said: &quot;Coordination makes the difference between being really successful and just being pretty good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The introduction of a new interdepartmental system for coordination was not sufficient to create a harmonious relationship between research and marketing. Attitudes of people at all levels of the company also had to change. It took ten years before people really came to feel that they should fully communicate and cooperate with each other. According to Huck the attitude is more important than the system. &quot;You probably need the system to get going, but that isn&#39;t enough. If you have the right attitudes, you could probably do it without the systems.&quot; Systems facilitate coordination and harmony at the physical level. But the right corporate attitude generates cooperation, which is a higher and more powerful form of harmony.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Merck has recognized the importance of corporate attitudes for fostering harmony within and without. As it stresses credibility in its relations with physicians, so it stresses trust in its relations with employees. John Lyons likened an organization to an internal-combustion engine. Friction is a major obstacle to the smooth running of them both. Friction dissipates a lot of energy as unproductive heat. It causes wear and tear on the parts, lowers efficiency, and slows speed. To counteract friction in a car engine, a cooling system and a lubricating system are utilized, both of which add extra weight and bulk to the vehicle. Companies introduce many cumbersome systems to reduce friction between individuals, departments, and divisions. Now suppose friction in the engine could be dramatically reduced by some means. All the extra systems could be scrapped. Equipment, operating, and maintenance costs would drop. Speed and efficiency would improve. Engineers have not yet discovered a way to eliminate friction in a car engine. But some companies have found a way to reduce organizational friction by encouraging positive corporate attitudes that generate cooperation and teamwork.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Organizational Harmony&mdash;Cooperation and Teamwork</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">General Mills gets its high-flying, youthful exuberance from the entrepreneurial spirit it fosters within the company. But if that were its only strength, you might find the company shattered by an infinite number of brilliant inspirations and great ideas, each headed in a different direction! The cement that bonds all these individuals together and makes all their energies and ideas productive is the spirit of team-work and cooperation that has evolved over the years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">General Mills has overcome the functional isolation between departments by establishing interdepartmental task forces, creating systems for coordination, and fostering an attitude of cooperation at all levels. The company has made significant gains in &quot;people productivity&quot; by developing teamwork among research and production, production and marketing, and marketing and sales. The Consumer Foods divisions organize groups for each new product. Representatives from each function (R&amp;D, marketing, and so on) work together as a team. The key to success is an attitude of shared responsibility. &quot;The controllers and the research guy and the market-research woman and the production person all feel that they&#39;ve got a much greater vested interest in it,&quot; one executive explained. Each division has come to recognize that it depends on the others in order to do its job properly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As we saw in Chapter 5, the gaps between systems possess a great potential power. General Mills focuses on these interfaces and tries to bridge the gaps through team management. Marketing and production people spend a lot of time talking to each other and trying to find ways to do things better. Working on the interfaces can result in substantial gains. The director of manufacturing in the Package Foods Operations Division thinks, &quot;There is a potential for reducing costs by 30 percent.&quot; But the key is the attitude of the team members. &quot;If the total system prospers, then you&#39;ll all prosper. If you come with a selfish motive that says, `I can only be successful if I climb the mountain higher than somebody else,&#39; then you&#39;re not going to get there. It requires cooperation. You&#39;re trying to build a team while still maintaining individual pride.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Cooperation not only saves money; it saves time, too. Raj Puri, a program manager in Consumer Foods, is involved in the launching of new products. He estimates that the company&#39;s team approach can reduce the time from conception of a new product to sales by as much as 40 percent to 50 percent, a savings of two years or more. Interfacing between research and manufacturing starts while the product is still in the laboratory. Once again, the key is attitude&mdash;&quot;trying to get people to look at the overall business. It broadens our horizons. Everyone has their boundaries and they have to expand across them,&quot; Puri says.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same close rapport exists at General Mills between sales and marketing, which are traditional adversaries in many corporations. A recent incident dramatically illustrates the power of harmony to evoke a response from the market. During the first eight months of 1984, sales in Consumer Foods were lagging behind the previous year. In September it was proposed that 12 separate food product groups combine their advertising budgets and marketing strategies into a single giant, promotion program, which required each product group to relinquish control over its own budget to a coordinating body.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The $20 million spent on the single promotion was the same amount budgeted for separate expenditure by the different product groups, but the results were far better&mdash;the biggest sales month in the history of the foods division. Walt LeSueur, director of sales administration, described the joint effort this way: &quot;It is not a marketing and a sales organization that are fighting each other. It&#39;s an integrated sales-marketing operation that works together and understands each other.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The power of teamwork is not something new at General Mills. The founder, James Bell, believed that it was the critical factor in the company&#39;s growth during the Great Depression. In 1939 he said: &quot;Because the organization of General Mills is necessarily diffuse and complex, it is all the more important that unity in action, recognition of individual responsibility and the spirit of cooperation prevail. This spirit&hellip;has been responsible for the company&#39;s success, progress and growth throughout a decade marked by depression and uncertainty.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt131" id="ftnt_ref131">[131]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;And, we can add, through 4&frac12; decades of prosperity since then, too.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Communication</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The basis of all harmony is communication between people. At the level of physical coordination, communication is needed to convey information between related people and points in the organization. Coca-Cola is able to control and coordinate activities around the world because it has developed a daily flow of two-way communication between the head office and its overseas subsidiaries. Coca-Cola has the ability to process the information it receives and to respond within 24 hours. It gets profit-and-loss reports from foreign subsidiaries twice a month and has a very accurate reading on monthly performance by the seventh calendar day of the following month, which is lightning fast for a company of this size operating in 155 different countries. As the company&#39;s chief financial officer said: &quot;The information flow creates a tremendous strength. The speed and accuracy of it are phenomenal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Communication is also essential for establishing organizational harmony. The basis of all cooperation between people depends on two things&mdash;an understanding and an attitude. Communication can create both. First, people must understand the importance of cooperation and the place of each active participant in the overall scheme of things. Second, they must acquire a willing attitude based on a recognition that cooperation serves the greater good of the organization. General Mills&#39; 12-product promotion was made possible by this understanding and this attitude.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Northwestern Mutual communication is a vital function, which supports a very high level of organizational harmony. There is a free flow of communication horizontally between related departments and also vertically between higher and lower levels of the company. The horizontal flow is promoted through a system of liaison committees, which serve to bridge the gap between related departments. Whatever may be said of the cumbersome nature of management by committees, they can play an invaluable role in fostering cooperation and team-work. Northwestern Mutual has made committees an effective channel for coordinating activities, fostering greater understanding, and overcoming negative attitudes within the company. Committees are also used to raise the level of cooperation between the office staff and the company&#39;s independent field agents. &quot;We have a pretty good understanding of our mutual interests,&quot; says Vice-President Dick Wright.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Northwestern Mutual supplements communication through the committees with educational programs to foster teamwork. A new videotape entitled &quot;In Search for Harmony&quot; is now being used to help the home office staff better understand and appreciate the needs and activities of the field agents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A harmonious family feeling is not just something management professes at Northwestern Mutual. &quot;You are treated like an individual. You&#39;re not just a cog in the wheel,&quot; says one middle manager. &quot;They really try to reach down into the clerical level, and I think they do succeed.&quot; Top management not only talks; it eagerly listens, too. &quot;There is an upward vertical movement of communication. They really do rely on the input of the people who are on the line. In fact, if they don&#39;t hear anything, they&#39;ll make [it] a point to solicit a comment. They always ask the service reps for input. That&#39;s why it gives you a sense of importance.&quot; The effectiveness of communication in fostering positive relationships at Northwestern Mutual can be judged from the results of a 1980 survey, which showed that 85 percent of the staff felt the company kept them well informed, and 97 percent had complete faith in the information they received.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Marriott teamwork is developed by regular communication through a system of management meetings and employee meetings, so that, as one executive put it: &quot;Everybody knows what we are trying to accomplish and&hellip;[is] reminded of it and encouraged toward it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Meetings are a much-maligned thing these days. A 1983 survey of U.S. executives found that 71 percent believe that meetings are a waste of time. But the real problem is not with meetings per se. Successful companies utilize meetings as a highly effective instrument for improving coordination and cooperation. Like any tool, meetings themselves are neutral. Their effectiveness depends on the skill of those who utilize them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination, cooperation, and communication enable the organization to harness the available energies more efficiently and utilize them more productively. Efforts to increase organizational harmony afford infinite scope for improving corporate effectiveness. As one bank official writes, with reference to meetings:</span></p><p class="c4 c26"><span class="c3">The room for advances in productivity through technological means may be growing scarce. It could therefore be that the next leap forward in productivity will come through the more effective management and organization of purely human activities.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt132" id="ftnt_ref132">[132]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Harmony</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Physical harmony is achieved by proper coordination of related activities through a network of interlinking systems. Organizational harmony is achieved when employees acquire a greater understanding of the work done by others and recognize the importance of cooperation and teamwork. But there is still a higher form of harmony, in which the bonding element is a feeling of identification with the company and a sense of belonging rather than a system, an understanding, or an attitude.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are a few companies in which cooperation, teamwork, and team spirit are raised to the level of a high ideal and core value of the psychic center. The company seeks them in preference to monetary goals, not just as a means to make greater profits. Cooperation and friendliness among peers are then augmented by a deeper sense of the company&#39;s commitment to its people and the individual employee&#39;s personal commitment to the firm. Cooperation in these companies transcends the necessities of work and the interests of efficiency. Neighborliness goes beyond the limits of mere courtesy and good relations. Harmony among employees and between employees and management is maintained even in the absence of special systems to promote it or peer pressure to enforce it. People are bound together by a set of values that they feel committed to live and work by. Harmony has become a custom or perhaps even a culture in the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When outsiders visit a company like this, they can perceive a warm, friendly atmosphere or family feeling in the air. This is how we felt when we visited Delta. So many companies speak about family feeling these days that the phrase is losing its real significance. But at Delta the thing is real and palpable, regardless of what you call it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many reasons can be given to explain it. C. E. Woolman was a kind, affectionate man. The company was started in a small southern town. It has a policy of preserving jobs in times of slack business, promotes from within, and pays high salaries. But in our view the single most important element is not these things. It is an abiding sense of security. How do you feel when you are in your own home with your own family? You feel safe and secure. Delta makes its people feel secure.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Security starts at the physical level&mdash;with safe airplanes. Delta employees believe that the company has the best-maintained fleet in the industry and will spare no effort or expense to keep it that way. This conviction generates a feeling of confidence and relaxation in a business where the fear of accidents is uppermost in the minds of many. &quot;There is never any thought of compromising safety,&quot; says Senior Vice President Joe Cooper. &quot;There is never any question in the employees&#39; minds that a piece of equipment is not the most reliable thing around.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Economic security is the basis of the company&#39;s employment policy. Employees know that once they are accepted into the family, their jobs are secure so long as they put in an honest day&#39;s work. Delta has never laid off workers for economic reasons&mdash;except a few pilots for a few months back in 1957. &quot;When times are tough, when the industry is going through a bad time, we don&#39;t have to think, `Where are we?&#39; We don&#39;t even think about it, because we know our jobs are going to be there,&quot; said one flight attendant. Delta has never had a strike. The company offers better compensation than most unions demand, so more than 90 percent of the employees do not bother to join one. As mechanic Lenny Meuse put it, &quot;If we needed a union here at Delta, we&#39;d have a union. But the way they treat you, we don&#39;t need one.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt133" id="ftnt_ref133">[133]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The company also has a generous retirement program to protect the whole family.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Delta tries to provide psychological security to its employees, too. We asked one senior executive what is the most important thing he tries to communicate to his staff. He replied, &quot;to give them peace of mind.&quot; Then he added. &quot;All of us that work at Delta are members of a family-type organization. A lot of people feel that is just a clich&eacute;, the Delta family; but our people and all of us really believe it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But the true measure of family feeling is in a company&#39;s acts, not in its words; and at Delta the action comes from an unexpected source&mdash;the employees. In 1982 77 percent of Delta&#39;s 37,000 employees contributed toward the purchase of a $30 million Boeing 767 for the company. That act expresses their feelings pretty loudly. &quot;You can interview as many people as you want,&quot; Meuse told us, &quot;but basically they&#39;ll all tell you the same thing: It&#39;s a great company to work for. They take care of us, and we try to take care of them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Harmony Attracts</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Harmony is a formidable power. It improves efficiency, reduces waste, minimizes friction, increases productivity, eliminates conflicts, relieves tension, releases enthusiasm, and generates joy. But that is not all. It also possesses the capacity to attract customers and make the market come to the company instead of the company&#39;s going to the market.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What makes a person attractive to other people? It is liveliness and charm, energy and harmony of personality. We are naturally attracted to people of high energy because we feel more intense and alive in their presence. If they have cheerful and harmonious personalities, we also feel calm, relaxed, and happy when we are with them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same is true of companies. Think for a moment of the companies that you keep going back to in preference to so many others. Sometimes it is because one firm&#39;s price is better than the others&#39;. Sometimes it is because of better quality. And sometimes&mdash;it is just because we feel better there. We enjoy it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When a company has a rich, harmonious personality, it becomes more attractive to customers. Sales personnel are more friendly. Service people are more cooperative. Operators are more cheerful. An associate of ours became a dedicated Delta fan long before he knew anything about the company or had ever flown on one of its flights, just because a Delta reservations agent was so helpful and friendly on the phone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A Merck professional representative explained a similar phenomenon. When the representatives are happy in their work, proud of the company, and have a positive attitude, &quot;it causes a ripple effect like in a lake. They are more effective, more positive, more persistent, more empathetic; and therefore, when the doctor is looking at you, he sees somebody he likes to be with.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Harmony is expansive. When Tom Watson increased the level of harmony at IBM during the 1930s with his policy of job security and job enrichment, not only did productivity and job satisfaction improve; the market responded, too, enabling IBM to grow right through the Great Depression. Harmony is attractive like a fashion. It spreads by itself and creates its own market where there was none before, because it meets a deeper need in people&mdash;the need for harmony in their own lives.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Uniting Opposites</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have so far spoken of harmony between activities, people, systems, and departments. But one of the highest forms of harmony is the capacity to reconcile conflicting values. A striking attribute of the companies we studied was their simultaneous adherence to two or more different, and apparently opposite, sets of values.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At General Mills we found a tremendous emphasis on individual entrepreneurship coupled with an equal insistence on cooperation and teamwork. At Merck there is hard-driving, aggressive selling linked with a meticulous insistence on objective, factual presentations&mdash;no easy combination. At Northwestern Mutual the highest priority is teamwork and committee-based, consensus decision making&mdash;two things that are known to slow momentum and dampen individual in itiative&mdash;yet the company has achieved the highest level of productivity and speed of response in its industry. Marriott utilizes the most sophisticated network of impersonal systems to deliver highly personalized and friendly service to its customers and to achieve the highest levels of profitability in the hotel food business&mdash;all at the same time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Companies that achieve a high level of corporate harmony are constantly reconciling and harmonizing conflicting sets of values in their everyday operations. The greater the apparent conflict between the values they adopt, the greater is the power that issues from harmonizing them.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Corporate Alignment</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Anyone who has ever driven across midtown Manhattan at 5 P.M. on a weekday knows what disharmony is all about. Traffic inches forward, jams together, and gets clogged at every intersection. Police look on helplessly. Traffic lights are useless. Pedestrians cross when and where they can. Trucks double-park to make their deliveries, backing up traffic for blocks. Everyone is going every which way, focused on individual destinations, in a total confusion and chaos that is certainly dangerous to people&#39;s psychological health, not to mention their physical safety.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Contrast this with the feeling of joy and ease cruising down Seventh Avenue at midnight after a Broadway show, with a long stream of synchronized traffic lights green for as far as you can see and hardly a dozen cars on the road. You float through the usually congested intersections as if on a magic carpet, without even looking to the left or right, because the lights are with you and it&#39;s all clear. You save a fortune on gasoline by avoiding all those stops and cut down wear on the brakes and gears. You travel in a few minutes a distance it took you an hour to cover in the afternoon. You feel safe and relaxed, with no fear of an accident and no tension on the nerves. Everything is going your way. That is what we mean by corporate harmony.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The key to the whole thing is the lights&mdash;synchronized green lights running all in a row. Nothing to slow you down. No barriers in the road. The lights set the direction of the traffic. This is the role that values play in a company when they are set high enough and seriously pursued. They act like lights clearly fixing the direction of all the traffic and helping it flow unhindered in the shortest time, at the least cost, and with the minimum of friction. The higher the value, the smoother the flow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are an infinite number of elements and points within an organization that can be properly aligned and harmonized with other elements of the same type and of different types, with other points at the same level and at different levels. The innumerable systems for production must be in harmony with each other as well as with the systems for purchasing, storage, accounting, distribution, and marketing. Systems at each level must be properly integrated with related systems at all the other levels above and below. They must also be in harmony with technical skills for production, marketing skills for selling what is produced, accounting skills for proper costing and pricing, and so on. So, too, they must be in harmony with the organizational structure and authority exercised. For instance, the system of unlocked laboratory storerooms at Hewlett-Packard depends very much on the milieu of positive authority in the company&#39;s corporate character. Systems must also be in harmony with the beliefs, values, and objectives of the psychic center. What is true of systems is true of the other elements as well. Skills must be in harmony with other skills at all levels, with the product, machinery, materials, marketing strategy, organizational structure, type of authority, values, and so on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This complex matrix of interacting elements can be depicted dramatically by a series of arrows, each arrow representing a different element in the organization and the direction of the arrow symbolizing the degree of its alignment with other elements.</span></p><a id="id.tzy7v0cvoevu"></a><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For instance, in Figure 6</span><a id="id.2vr6fsyexbxl"></a><span class="c3">&nbsp;we have a simple case of disharmony between values and skills.

Often such a moment comes in response to a threatening crisis, as it did at Chrysler a few years ago. When things take a sudden and dramatic turn for the worse, people become more alert, flexible, dynamic, and cooperative. They stop insisting on their opinions, stop standing on prestige, brush aside their grievances, and forget their feuds. Everyone pitches in to save the situation. Activities are better coordinated, departments cooperate with each other, people work with a team spirit, and work flows smoothly. A company that appeared to be in the throes of death suddenly revives with an unexpected freshness and vivacity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The sudden opening up of a new opportunity can also push harmony to new heights within an organization, as it did at Apple during the first phase of the company&#39;s life. In such an expansive period, no one has a moment to think about job security, because the company is hiring as fast as it can and does not even have free personnel to handle recruitment. Every secretary and sales rep is given maximum freedom and responsibility because there is more work than anyone can handle. Every day brings fresh surprises and fresh triumphs that send thrills through the organization. Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are streamlined in the rush to meet deadlines. Inefficient systems are upgraded and refined to handle greater activity faster. Negative opinions and nonwork attitudes are drowned in a sea of optimism and success. The whole staff feels a sense of pride and joy at being part of a successful, rapidly expanding venture. A harmonious team spirit pervades the organization. The company responds to the market by increasing its internal harmony, and the market responds to that harmony by becoming more expansive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The types of harmony generated by a crisis or an opportunity are both inherently limited by the fact that they arise in response to the pressure of external circumstances, which is usually temporary. In a crisis the harmonious atmosphere is likely to last only so long as the crisis itself. In an expansive period it is likely to last only so long as the opportunity is expanding faster than the organization can adapt to it. Once growth slows down or levels off, divisive tendencies that have been held in check come to the surface.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For harmony to become a permanent attribute of the corporate personality, it must be generated from within the organization itself as an aspiration to realize some inspiring ideal&mdash;a higher value or lofty goal. The internal pressure of that constant quest generates harmony. The higher the ideal, the greater the harmony that results. A corporate ideal like rapid growth or high quality generates a force for harmony within departments. A social ideal like the well-being of employees (Delta) or service to society (AT&amp;T) generates a power of harmony at the corporate level that can integrate and unify the entire organization.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.i0n8bnjsaqrk"><span class="c3">When harmony becomes a permanent attribute of a corporation, the response of the market becomes permanent, too. The market reveals to the company a scope for endless expansion and enduring success.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 10 - Harmony Without</span></h1><p class="c39"><span class="c3">All things are interwoven with one another; a sacred bond unites them; there is scarcely one thing that is isolated from another. Everything is coordinated, everything works together in giving form to the one universe.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c3">&mdash;Marcus Aurelius</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt134" id="ftnt_ref134">[134]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the beginning of this century, an English scientist working in India conducted a bold and dramatic experiment that confounded the medical profession. He selected a herd of healthy Indian cattle, designed hygienic accommodations for them, and fed them a properly blended diet along with clean, fresh water. When veterinary officials came to inoculate the animals, he refused to permit it. To the surprise of the veterinarians and the neighboring farmers, his animals did not catch any of the diseases prevalent even among inoculated cattle in the area. And to the utter amazement of everyone, his animals remained free of disease even when they were put in physical contact with diseased animals. His animals were so healthy that the disease that scourged the countryside could not affect them. That is the power of harmony within.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Survival and Growth in Hard Times</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are equally astonishing stories about companies that maintained their position or even continued to grow in an unsupportive or hostile business environment because of the harmony they had established within their organizations and their capacity for rapid adjustment to changes in the world around them. When Alfred Sloan took over as president of an ailing GM in 1920, the company was in chaos and struggling for survival. Within five years he built it up into the world&#39;s largest automaker, surpassing Ford, which was entering a period of decline. Sloan transformed GM into America&#39;s first decentralized big business organization based on centralized policy making, strategic planning, sophisticated systems of financial and operating controls, and market forecasting. He created a high level of internal harmony by coordinating all activities within each subsidiary and integrating many diverse businesses within a single, unified organizational structure.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sloan regarded periodic business slumps as inevitable and believed that the true test of an organization was its ability to prosper during these difficult periods. When the Great Depression set in, GM sales tumbled by two-thirds in three years. But by this time the company had built up its systems for coordination to such an extent that it was able to respond quickly to the disastrous slump in the market and adjust its purchasing, production, inventory, and employment levels accordingly. As a result, GM made profits and paid dividends every year during the 1930s, a period that almost proved fatal to Ford Motor Company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">GM&#39;s remarkable performance was possible because of its high level of internal coordination coupled with its very close contact with the market, utilizing sophisticated market-forecasting techniques first developed at Du Pont. In other words, the company had developed internal harmony and harmony with its market&mdash;harmony within and harmony without.</span></p><p class="c4 c72"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Otto Doering was tying the golden knots that bound Sears&#39; mail-order system together, something equally or more important for the company was taking place down in Panama, where Robert Wood was working on the construction of the Panama Canal under General Goethals. Due to the scarcity of good books in Panama, Wood developed the habit of perusing successive annual editions of the U.S. statistical abstracts; and between the monotonous columns of figures, he observed three significant trends: the automobile was making America mobile, farmers were migrating to the cities, and the urban working class was acquiring middle-class tastes, purchasing power, and buying habits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The net result of Wood&#39;s unusual taste in books was that when he joined Sears in 1924, he reformulated the company&#39;s mission. &quot;We&#39;re going to offer values to the great middle class buying public of American citizens.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt135" id="ftnt_ref135">[135]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Then he opened the first of Sears&#39; large suburban retail stores, conveniently accessible to the increasingly mobile middle class. By 1929 Sears had 268 stores with combined sales of $175 million, which represented 40 percent of the company&#39;s total revenues.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">During the early years of the depression, retail trade in the United States dropped by nearly 50 percent. Even department stores, which were usually located in downtown urban areas, suffered a 40 percent fall in sales, and it took them a decade to recover to their predepression level. Yet throughout this period, Sears&#39; sales and income continued to grow. By 1931 its retail business had larger revenues than its mailorder division. Sears succeeded because it sensed the changing temper of the times. It attuned itself to meet an unfulfilled need of the society that was increasing, even at a time when the economy as a whole was shrinking. Harmony without has an extraordinary power.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">A Gigantic Golden Gap</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Another good thing happened to Wood while he was in Panama. He discovered the importance of reliable supply lines and learned how to establish them. General Goethals put Wood in full charge of supplies for building the canal, with one simple admonition: &quot;The day we run out of cement, you&#39;re fired.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt136" id="ftnt_ref136">[136]</a></sup><span class="c41 c66 c15">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">This fortuitous circumstance placed on Wood the burden of recruiting, housing, and feeding nearly 50,000 people while simultaneously maintaining an uninterrupted supply of cement, which could not be stored for any length of time owing to the tropical climate. His experiences under Goethals formed the inspiration for the unique buying system that Wood introduced at Sears&mdash;a system based on harmony with suppliers.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">By this time, mass production and mass distribution were both established systems of activity in the United States; yet the link between these two powerful but independent systems was tenuous. Wood discovered a golden gap in the interface between them that contained far more gold than Otto Doering&#39;s integrated mail-order systems.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The basis of Wood&#39;s buying system was the principle that both the mass manufacturer and the mass distributor could make more money if they worked together harmoniously for their common benefit. By purchasing raw materials in bulk on behalf of all its suppliers, Sears was able to obtain substantial discounts on the huge volume of materials it required, which none of its suppliers could get by purchasing the materials themselves. By working closely with the manufacturers to improve the quality of their products and the efficiency of production techniques, Sears was able to buy better merchandise at a lower price, and the manufacturers were able to earn more on what they produced. By guaranteeing manufacturers orders far in advance, suppliers were able to maintain more stable production schedules and avoid the costly waste from frequent start-ups and shutdowns. By eliminating the need for advertising and large sales divisions, the manufacturers cut their total costs by 15 percent to 20 percent on sales to Sears and could pass on part of that savings to their customer.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The cumulative result of these mutual advantages was that both Sears and the manufacturers prospered beyond anyone&#39;s expectations. In one dramatic instance, Wood offered financial assistance and a guaranteed market to an ailing manufacturer of locomotive parts if it would switch over to the production of refrigerators instead. The descendant of that company is Whirlpool Corporation, which ranks among the top 150 industrial firms in the United States, with $2.6 billion in revenues. The benefit that Sears derived was even more dramatic. Competitors simply could not match the merchandise values and prices Sears could offer because of its harmonious system.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Wood guided the destiny of Sears from 1924 to 1954. Even at the time that he assumed command, the company was the nation&#39;s largest retailer. During the next three decades, its sales grew 15-fold, from $206 million to $3 billion, and its profits grew 10-fold, from $14 million to $141 million. This phenomenal expansion, which took place despite the intervention of the Great Depression and World War II, was largely the result of one thing, harmony without&mdash;harmony with a rapidly changing society and harmony with suppliers.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c15">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">A New Frontier</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Over the decades Sears has displayed a remarkable ability to perceive, before most other companies, the significance of changes in society and to adopt new strategies suited to tap the commercial opportunities that these changes opened up. This capacity to remain in harmony with the needs of society has unquestionably been the company&#39;s greatest strength.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">When Wood opened Allstate Insurance Company units in retail stores, the financial experts of the day were highly skeptical of the move. Today, under the direction of Edward Telling, Sears is in the process of an even more dramatic shift in strategy to take advantage of what it perceives to be an enormous untapped commerical opportunity created by changes in society. The recent acquisition of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., one of the largest U.S. securities brokerage firms, and Coldwell Banker, the nation&#39;s largest full-service real estate company, and the establishment of integrated financial-service centers in its retail stores are the core of that strategy.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">What prompted Sears&#39; most recent new departure? Edward R. Telling, chairman and CEO of Sears, explains: &quot;We are facing up to the </span><span class="c2">new realities of the American marketplace</span><span class="c3">. The American economic, political, and social condition has undergone a radical change; a change that calls out for new products&hellip;new services&hellip;new ways of doing business.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt137" id="ftnt_ref137">[137]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;A major Sears strategy to respond to these changes is a new approach to the marketing of financial services.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">As in the past, many people have scoffed at or been bewildered by what seems to be a sudden shift in Sears&#39; strategy. Even the companies that Sears acquired did not fully comprehend the underlying rationale for the move and the incredible potentials it has uncovered until some months after the acquisitions had taken place. There were many so-called sophisticated New Yorkers who even laughed at the idea that a commoner from Chicago could possibly understand something about financial markets that Wall Street failed to perceive. But laughter is rapidly giving way to a mixture of awe and fear.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Sears is quick to present its credentials for such a venture. After all, the company started offering installment credit on farm equipment and major appliances without collateral way back in 1911, at a time when most banks refused to make such loans. Wood started Allstate Insurance Company in 1931 to sell car insurance through Sears&#39; retail stores and mail-order catalog with an initial investment of $700,000. Fifty years later Allstate is the second largest property-casualty insurer in the country, with more than $12.7 billion in assets, $8 billion in revenues, and earnings of $555 million in 1983. Sears has also operated a commercial real estate company since the 1950s, and it owns saving banks in California and Delaware. In addition, the company presently lends $12 billion to American consumers through its credit-card system.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">But all these qualifications are really secondary. Sears&#39; best credential for the move is its historic capacity to stay in tune with the needs of middle America. It is not any extraordinary acumen that enables it to do so. Sears possesses the objectivity, humility, and common sense to maintain harmony with the world in which it lives, grows, and prospers. Carl Hulick, vice-president of Dean Witter, calls it &quot;a self-effacing intelligence.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Sears simply looked at the numbers and read the writing on the wall. About 85 percent of all American households with incomes of $30,000 or more, 70 percent of those with incomes of $36,000 or more, and nearly 75 percent of all households doing business with New York Stock Exchange firms are current Sears customers.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The typical customer of the investment houses is in the upper-income, higher-net-worth group. But there are millions of prosperous American households with billions of dollars in savings that find the off-the-street, uptown New York or downtown Beverly Hills investment firm inaccessible and too imposing to approach freely. But when you put that account executive in a Sears&#39; store, the psychology changes, and a powerful chemical reaction occurs.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Since the first Sears financial center was opened, Dean Witter has found that 35 percent to 40 percent of all its new business is coming from the stores, and the average account executive in the stores is opening twice as many new accounts as those in Dean Witter&#39;s own offices. About 62 percent of these new accounts are first-time customers of a brokerage firm, and another 18 percent are reactivated accounts&mdash;that is, 80 percent are additional customers for the investment industry. More than half of them are women. As a test case, Sears opened one financial center in a middle-income, blue collar neighborhood in Chicago. This store turned out to be the most successful of the initial eight centers. As Hulick said, in that store &quot;we had discovered a pocket of mattress money.&quot; And the same results repeated in other cities around the country.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Sears has been able to capitalize not only on its retail store infra-structure and its ongoing relationship with half of all American households but also on the familiarity and confidence customers feel in dealing with the company renowned for its money-back guarantee. One lady walked into one of the financial centers and said she had never invested money before because she did not trust brokers. When the broker explained that he was a Dean Witter stockbroker, she replied: &quot;No, you aren&#39;t. You&#39;re with Sears!&quot; What Allstate&#39;s Chairman Donald Craib said of his company is proving true for Sears&#39; new partners, too: &quot;Our greatest strength is our affiliation with Sears, Roebuck and Company. It was, is, and will be, because we draw from that same core of customers, and it&#39;s a huge one and a loyal one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The move into financial services signifies a further modification in Sears&#39; corporate mission. The company is broadening its scope to serve more of the needs of the American household&mdash;merchandising, insurance, real estate, brokerage, and consumer credit. Sears hopes that it can sell Americans their homes, furniture, and automobile spares, as well as insurance, stocks, and bonds, and ultimately become a consumer bank. Hulick recalls when the magnitude of Sears&#39; idea suddenly dawned on him. &quot;I can remember sitting in the meeting when the light bulb went on. There is an absolutely huge potential. My gut feeling is that it could be bigger than anyone can conceive of right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The potential Sears has uncovered was not created by the invention of a new technology or the production of a new product. It is the result of an effort that every company can make&mdash;an effort to establish greater and wider harmony with the ever changing needs of society.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c15">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">Infinite Opportunities</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Tomas Bata was fond of telling the story of two shoe salesmen who went to explore the market potential in an African country. One cabled back to the home office: &quot;No one here wears shoes. No market.&quot; The other cabled: &quot;Everyone here is barefoot. Infinite potential.&quot; Bata saw that potential long before much bigger firms in the West and went on to create the largest shoe company in the world.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">One need not go to Africa in search of such potentials. They are there all around us in every industry for every company. For some it may be creating a new product or developing a new technology. But there are equally vast opportunities to be tapped simply by changing one&#39;s perspective, one&#39;s strategy, or one&#39;s attitude. Sears has done it very consciously three times in its 100 years of business, Coca-Cola did it almost accidentally in the last century, when its product came to be identified with the social aspirations of the common people.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The phenomenal development of the personal computer market was not simply the result of a new technology for reducing the size and price of computers. It was the product of a revolutionary new way of thinking about the computer and its role in society. Even long after new technologies were available for bringing down the price and simplifying use of the computer, the traditional computer makers were slow to see the potential.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Computers were originally thought to have applications only for big businesses and governments. In the late forties the most reliable market research indicated that the world market could absorb 1,000 computers by the year 2000. By the midseventies 50,000 computers had been installed around the world. In 1984 alone computer sales were about 2 million units. This incredible expansion was due to the capacity of companies like Apple to identify themselves with the needs of social groups that fell far outside the traditional market for computers&mdash;the individual, the family, the small business, and the school.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">While companies and educational institutions were gearing up to the onerous task of teaching people how to communicate with the computer in a multitude of strange languages, Apple was doing an admirable job of simplifying the interface between people and computers. Apple bridged the intellectual and psychological gap that separated people from the machine. According to </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">, &quot;No company has done more than Apple to dispel the notion that computers are inscrutable beasts.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt138" id="ftnt_ref138">[138]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Apple&#39;s Macintosh personal computer, writes </span><span class="c2">Business Week</span><span class="c3">, &quot;is so easy to handle that many people do not even bother to read the instruction manual.&hellip;&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt139" id="ftnt_ref139">[139]</a></sup><span class="c41 c66 c15">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Companies that exploit existing markets reap rewards in proportion to their efficiency, the size of the market, and the strength of the competition. But companies that convert unseen market potential into actualities expand at a phenomenal rate, as Apple has.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">What Apple has done in a product business, Federal Express has done in a service industry. It identified a need that stalwarts in the field had failed to meet. It created a new $1.4 billion business for itself and a new $5 billion overnight-delivery industry out of the existing parcel-delivery industry that UPS entered in 1907.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Marriott is now making a parallel move with its life-care communities, which are designed to cater to the needs of America&#39;s growing population of healthy senior citizens. This service combines the independence of the private residence with the convenience and security of centralized recreational, food, and medical facilities. It is a natural extension of Marriott&#39;s existing business and a natural outgrowth of changing social requirements.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Exploding the Myth of Limits</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The concept of a fixed, limited market is an illusion. When a new product is introduced that caters to a real need of the society&mdash;such as the automobile, telephone, radio, TV, or computer&mdash;the market grows until it saturates the society at one level. Introduce one new variable&mdash;like lower price, new applications, better quality, smaller size, more pleasant service, greater convenience&mdash;then the need for the product increases, and a new market opens. To be in harmony means to discover these latent needs of the marketplace and adapt the product to meet them.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The same thing is true of service businesses as well. There are two parts to the delivery of any service: a physical part, like food or a seat on an airplane, and a social part, which relates to satisfying the customers through courtesy, convenience, and personal attention. There is a balance between these two. The fast-food restaurant delivers a low-cost product. Speed and price are primary. The high-class restaurant serves better-quality food, but it also places greater emphasis on comfort, elegance, and pleasant behavior. There is only so much you can do to the physical quality or the desirability of a hamburger or a seat on an airline. But there is infinite scope for varying and improving the social and psychological qualities surrounding the service. The most successful service companies are those that put themselves in harmony with the nonphysical needs of their customers. Delta does it through warmth and friendliness, Disneyland through cheerfulness, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. through authenticity, and McDonald&#39;s through cleanliness and courtesy.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Society not only has physical needs; it has social and psychological needs as well. At a time when the family has been fragmented, personal isolation is constantly increasing, and nervous tension has become endemic, the nonmaterial needs of modern society are as great and pressing as the physical requirements of many developing countries. Companies can address these needs by providing job security for their employees; creating a family feeling in the office; offering friendly, personalized service to customers; acting as genuine agents of goodwill in the society; or providing products and services that entertain, educate, and relax consumers and protect their health.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">How well is American business tuning in to its environment? According to a survey by Opinion Research Corporation released in 1984, there is ample scope for improvement. Only 14 percent of those polled expressed a high level of trust and confidence in large American companies. Large companies rated very poorly on ethics and morality, job creation, protecting the environment, and meeting the needs of society. The survey revealed that 69 percent of the public believe that business is a social as well as an economic entity, that it has an obligation to help society, and that it is presently neglecting society&#39;s problems.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt140" id="ftnt_ref140">[140]</a></sup><span class="c41 c15 c66">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The answer to this negative image is not more or better public relations activity or greater philanthropic activity, however worth-while that activity may be in its own right. The greatest service that business can perform for the nation is to meet its seen and unseen, felt and unfelt real needs more and more efficiently, effectively, honestly, pleasantly, and harmoniously. As Drucker has written, business has to learn &quot;how to convert the major social challenges facing developed societies today into novel and profitable business opportunities.&hellip;&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt141" id="ftnt_ref141">[141]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The opportunities for that conversion are as rich and vast as American society itself.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">When a company is in harmony with society, the growth potential is unlimited; the scope for expansion is infinite. Take the greatest commercial successes in American history and plug them into the formula. A good number have done nothing more spectacular than to serve.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c15">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">Social Unity</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">The lesson of harmony is a very simple one. But too often it is forgotten. Chrysler blatantly ignored it during the 1960s and 1970s by alienating its customer base with drastic changes in styling and by overloading most of its intermediate-size cars with 500-horsepower gas-guzzling engines, even after the fad for the racer image had ended and the oil crunch had begun. The crisis that the company passed through a few years ago was a direct result of this error and, one would think, enough to teach anyone the lesson. Chrysler&#39;s president, Harold Sperlich, constantly repeats a new refrain: &quot;You really have to cooperate with your environment.&hellip;You have to cooperate with the market.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt142" id="ftnt_ref142">[142]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Cooperation means harmony.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Chrysler really saw the power of harmony in 1980 when it approached the very brink of bankruptcy. Literally the entire society came to its rescue. The U.S. government granted $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees, and Canada gave $200 million more. Banks provided the company with $642 million in new loans, deferred interest, or interest give-ups. State and local governments came up with $357 million in support. Suppliers and dealers granted $63 million in concessions. And the United Auto Worker&#39;s agreed to a three-year labor contract that would save Chrysler $462 million in wages and benefits.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">None of these benefactors was acting solely out of philanthropic compassion for an ailing company. All of them recognized that they constitute a single, unified, productive entity called society and that their interests are inseparably intertwined. The positive attitude of cooperation and support has been generally ignored by experts trying to explain Chrysler&#39;s successful recovery. Harmony between many interdependent units was the essential key to it all.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c15">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Life Without Limit</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Throughout this book we have drawn an analogy between the life of an individual and the life of an organization. However, in one critical respect the person and the company differ. The life of the individual is limited; the life of a company can continue as long as the society in which it lives. It can continue even longer perhaps by transplanting itself to another society, as Bata Shoe Company did when the Communists took over in Czechoslovakia.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">At the time of their birth, both the individual and the organization are children of the society in which they are born. They acquire its ideas, values, attitudes, norms, customs, habits, behaviors, and life-style. These things form the basis for the development of their personalities. But meanwhile, the society continues to change. It accepts new ideas, modifies its values, adopts new customs, accepts new forms of behavior, and so forth. The individual finds after four or five decades that the beliefs and values so easily accepted in youth are no longer prevalent. Many people discover the truth in the adage that a person can move from being a flaming liberal to a deep conservative to a complete reactionary in one lifetime, frequently without any fundamental change in viewpoint. The individual may remain the same, but society moves on. As the gap widens between the two, the individual is relegated to a back seat, so that another generation can carry on the forward march.</span></p><p class="c4 c25"><span class="c3">Old age and obsolescence are not inevitable for an organization if it continues to remain in harmony with its parent society. Companies can and do extend their lives, revitalize their energies, and transform themselves to meet new challenges and opportunities, as Sears and AT&amp;T are doing today. This process of renewal is the process of corporate evolution, a constant inner growth and continuous outer adaptation to ongoing changes in society. It opens up the possibility for the organization to continuously expand and develop as the society expands and develops without end or limit. </span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24" id="h.xopbf0kkucvr"><span class="c15 c37">&nbsp;Chapter &nbsp;11 - The Significant Individual </span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One essential question remains unasked and unanswered. We have spoken about the importance of beliefs and values, mission and objectives, attitudes, hierarchy, discipline, freedom, systems, skills, material things, coordination, integration, and harmony. But what about the most important of all organizational resources&mdash;the individual? What is the significance of the individual in the life of a corporation?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Historically, the most significant individual in the life of a company has been the founder or an outstanding CEO who came later. Such people have imparted the values and formulated the mission that set the company&#39;s direction. They have molded the corporate character and invested all their energies to make the organization come alive. Leaders like Rosenwald and Wood, Vail and Sloan, Woolman and Woodruff, Bata and Marriott and their descendants have created organizations as extensions of their own personalities and given them an independent existence. These people identified themselves so closely with the life of the organizations that, as it was observed of Tom Watson, it is difficult to say where the personality of one ends and the personality of the other begins.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It was not money or position that made these leaders significant. It was attitude and effort&mdash;a willingness to give themselves to the organization and to work hard. Work was their religion. With characteristic humor and understatement, Woodruff once remarked: &quot;It was not so difficult. It was mostly a matter of working all the time.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt143" id="ftnt_ref143">[143]</a></sup><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Watson almost made it sound easy: &quot;It isn&#39;t a hard thing to build up a business if you are willing to do a reasonable amount of work.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt144" id="ftnt_ref144">[144]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Make no mistake about it, Watson&#39;s idea of &quot;reasonable&quot; was not 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Nor was Bill Marriott, Sr.&#39;s. He said, &quot;No one can get very far in this life on a forty-hour week.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt145" id="ftnt_ref145">[145]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It is easy to attribute the accomplishments of these leaders to some rare talents or genius, but nearly all of them have frankly denied anything of the kind. Woodruff was quite notably ordinary. &quot;Bob has no particular talents,&quot; as one of his dearest admirers and successors at Coca-Cola said. Woolman was a lovable workaholic, but hardly extraordinary except in that regard. James Buchanan Duke, the founder of the American Tobacco Company, was quite explicit about it:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">I have succeeded in business not because I have more natural ability than those who have not succeeded, but because I have applied myself harder and stuck to it longer. I know plenty of people who have failed to succeed in anything who have more brains than I had, but they lacked application and determination.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt146" id="ftnt_ref146">[146]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Edison&#39;s well-known remark sums it up best: &quot;Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt147" id="ftnt_ref147">[147]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Despite the understandable tendency of those around them to admire these leaders and even deify them, it was more an extraordinary effort than an exceptional talent, more a right attitude than a brilliant intellect, that led to their success. The attitude, like the effort, was total and unwavering, a decision to act, a determination to achieve, and an enthusiasm for the challenge. As Duke explained shortly before his death:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">I resolved from the time I was a mere boy to do a big business. I loved business better than anything else. I worked from early morning until late at night. I was sorry to have to leave off at night and glad when morning came so I could set at it again.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt148" id="ftnt_ref148">[148]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Admittedly, these individuals did share one characteristic in greater than normal measure, and that was energy. But where did their energy come from? It was itself a product of a decision, a determination, and an enthusiasm. Effort and commitment are the twin keys that release the energy stored up within the human personality. The effort and commitment are the result of a decision. The decision is the expression of an idea. The idea is an idealistic value or a high, distant goal. The idea fixes the direction, the decision sets it in motion, the effort and commitment carry it forward, and the enthusiams lifts it to success. A high idea, a clear decision, a firm commitment, and an overflowing enthusiasm released the energy of these individuals and transformed it into intensity.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Becoming Significant</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process these leaders passed through in achieving success is familiar to us, for it is exactly the same in the individual as it is in the company. Individual personality and corporate personality follow the same path in their development. It has been the thesis of this book that any company that has the knowledge of the process and is willing to make the effort can achieve enduring success. Therefore, it is only logical to ask: Can any individual with a similar knowledge and making a similar effort achieve lasting significance? He or she can indeed. Enduring success for a company and lasting significance for the individual both have the same source. It lies in the undiscovered potentials of personality, individual and corporate.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In truth, the greatest discovery that significant individuals have made was not the unlimited power of organization, though all of them released at least a tiny portion of it, but rather the unlimited potentials of human personality within themselves. They were not so much great leaders possessing great power as they were individuals in whom great power was released, making them appear great.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Any company that really wants to achieve enduring success can achieve it. Any individual who really wants to become significant can become so. The emphasis is on the word </span><span class="c2">wants</span><span class="c3">, because it is &quot;mostly a matter of working all the time,&quot; as Woodruff said.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Individual Growth and Corporate Success</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How do people become significant? They become significant when they decide to fully develop their capacities and improve their personalities as much as they possibly can. They become significant to the company when they grow. Peter Drucker has written in </span><span class="c2">The Practice of Management</span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Man is distinguished from all other resources in that his &quot;development&quot; is not something that is done to him; it is not another or better way of using existing properties. It is growth; and </span><span class="c2">growth is always from within</span><span class="c3">. The work therefore must encourage the growth of the individual and must direct it&mdash;otherwise it fails to take full advantage of the specific properties of the human resource.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt149" id="ftnt_ref149">[149]</a></sup><span class="c22">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">[Emphasis added.]</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Contrary to what many believe, life in an organization presents excellent opportunities for individual growth, because people grow primarily through work and social interaction, which are the basis of corporate existence. The greatest benefit an individual can derive from work is the growth of his or her personality to make the person better, stronger, more productive, and happier. The greatest benefit a company can derive from its people is to foster their personal growth, so that their energies and talents can be made fully available to enliven and enhance the life of the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">General Wood once reminded his staff at Sears: &quot;We must always consider our 150,000 employees as 150,000 individual human beings, with personalities of their own&hellip;who have faith in their leaders, who believe not only in their ability, but in their fairness and justice, and who in return give of their best, freely and willingly. If all of Sears is animated by this spirit, </span><span class="c2">nothing can stop us.</span><sup class="c2"><a href="#ftnt150" id="ftnt_ref150">[150]</a></sup><span class="c3">&quot; [Emphasis added.]</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Who is Significant?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What makes an individual significant? We are all significant individuals in our own personal lives; but although most of us like to think so, very few are really significant in the life of a company. Sure, many of us do excellent work, receive recognition, move closely with our boss. Some of us have made a very important sale for the company on occasion or helped develop a new product or a new process. When a special talent or skill is required, many are sought out for their capacity&mdash;a crack sales rep to handle a big customer, a bright lawyer for a tough negotiation, a brilliant engineer to solve a difficult technical problem, a knowledgeable accountant to bring order out of chaotic numbers, a manager with a way with words to handle an irate employee or customer, a secretary with a flair for creating advertising copy or drafting letters, a supervisor who inspires subordinates to work hard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These are notable accomplishments for any employee, but they are not what we mean by being a significant individual in the company. A significant individual is one whom the company needs for its work, not one who needs the company for his or her living. Bill Marriott, Jr., is a significant individual who everyone agrees works harder than anyone else in the company. Why, we asked? To set an example, &quot;so everyone else will work hard,&quot; he replied. Telling and Brennan are significant individuals at Sears, who have a vision of the future and are guiding the company to realize it. Goizueta is a significant individual who has directed Coca-Cola into new fields. So is Steve Jobs at Apple.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All these leaders happen to be presidents and chairpersons of the companies they work for, but that is not the real criterion by which to judge their significance. Many chairpersons and CEOs, even of large companies, really do not play a very significant role in the lives of their companies&hellip;especially when their contribution is viewed from a historical perspective. Anyone can be significant at any level or in any position. Whoever the significant individuals are, they have these essential attributes:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. They feel the work is more important than they are, and they sacrifice their personal convenience in favor of the work. That is why significant people are never nine-to-fivers for five days a week. They are like C. E. Woolman, of whom it was said, &quot;Delta Air Lines was his life.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt151" id="ftnt_ref151">[151]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. They always think about the work that is yet to be done and do not dwell on past achievements.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. They are not really looking for external recognition and rewards, although both always come in abundant measure. Their real motive for work is the challenge of accomplishment and the sheer joy of growing. They love work because it is its own fulfillment. &quot;I had always enjoyed going to work,&quot; said Geneen. &quot;In fact, I never thought of it as work. It was a part of my life, a part of the environment in which I lived and breathed.&hellip; Business could be a great adventure, a lot of fun, something to look forward to every day, and the rewards went much further than one&#39;s annual salary and bonuses.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt152" id="ftnt_ref152">[152]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. They do not just work long hours or spend all their energy. They constantly strive to acquire new skills and to shed present weaknesses, so that they can perform at the </span><span class="c2">highest possible level</span><span class="c3">. They are never satisfied with themselves and always want to be better than they presently are. They try to continuously raise the peak level of their performance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. They are constantly being sought after by the company to take on new and higher responsibilities and constantly being catapulted to higher levels of the organization or to larger organizations and greater rewards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many individuals possess one or two of these attributes. There are a number of people who come to work an hour early and leave three hours after closing and work on weekends, too. But that alone is not enough to be significant. They must also work at their highest possible level all the time by developing new capacities, not just work hard and long at what they know or do best. There are many who like their work and the people they work with, the travel, the conventions, the challenge of making a sale or designing a better product, but that, too, is not enough unless they feel the joy that comes from constantly growing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are people who may even meet the first four criteria&mdash;they may be hardworking, always striving to improve, thinking only of the work still to be done, and feel refreshed and enthused by what they do&mdash;yet still not find new opportunities and greater rewards thrust upon them because they do not understand the process by which people grow. They have the goal, the willingness, the urge, and the right attitude, but not the knowledge of how to convert their hidden talents into developed capacities and to effectively express them in action for the good of the company and their own personal growth. This book is especially intended for companies that really want to achieve enduring success but do not know the process. This chapter is especially meant for individuals who really want to become significant but do not know how.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Way</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">No individual by virtue of birth, family, wealth, or social position has a monopoly on achievement, any more than any company by virtue of size, resources, or influence has a monopoly on success. Any company at any level can prosper and grow to one, ten, a hundred, or a thousand times its present size. Sears started with nothing and accomplished it over half a century. Apple started with nothing and did it in less than a decade. Whatever the size, whatever the field, there are no limits to growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We have all known many people&mdash;childhood friends, college roommates, office colleagues, or neighbors&mdash;who seemed to be just like us; yet inexplicably, by some stroke of good fortune or particular talent, they shot up in life to a far higher level. To the astonishment of long-time Sears employees, Edward Brennan was promoted to head the merchandise group at the young age of 46 and became president at 50. Brennan started as a salesman in a Wisconsin Sears store in 1956. Ron Allen, an engineer, joined Delta in 1963 doing part-time drafting work and came up through the personnel division to become president in 1984. Don Craib joined Allstate as a claims adjuster in 1950, then became a field manager, and gradually worked his way up till he reached the chairman&#39;s post in 1980. Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola&#39;s Cuban-born chairman, joined the company as a chemist 30 years ago and moved up through the ranks of middle management. At General Mills we met a young marketing director who joined the company just eight years ago as an intern while still in graduate school. She has already been promoted four times and seems headed for a vice-president&#39;s job in the near future.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">If your own career has not been quite so meteoric, still there may have been a period when you made rapid progress. If you recall now what happened at the time, the urge that drove you forward, the effort you made, the self-discipline you exercised over yourself, the steps and stages you passed through in developing a talent or acquiring a skill, then you get a glimpse of the process by which individuals become significant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is a process by which people rise, though many may not be consciously aware of how they have done it. It is not a process meant only for one in a million. It is available to all who really want to achieve and are willing to make the effort. According to psychologists, people utilize only 10 percent of their mental capacities in living a normal life. They also use only a tiny fraction of the energy and abilities their personality is capable of expressing. When individuals release this potential energy and develop these latent talents, they grow. When they channel all that energy into work and express all those talents in their jobs, they become significant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">According to Richard Wytmar, president of an executive recruiting firm, any manager can become an &quot;indispensable executive,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt153" id="ftnt_ref153">[153]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;provided that the manager is willing to make the effort to develop his or her capacities and that he or she takes a positive attitude toward the work. There is a way.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Prerequisites</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are certain conditions and prerequisites required to become eligible for any great opportunity in life. The opportunity to become significant is no exception. First of all, you have to know where you are and where you want to go. You have to ask yourself, as Wytmar suggests, What are my strengths? What are my weaknesses? How do my skills compare with those of others who have risen to higher levels in the organization? Do I possess all the skills that my boss possesses or that his or her boss possesses? &quot;If you want to move ahead, you&#39;ve got to look around your organization and ask yourself what kind of skills you need in order to make the move to other positions,&quot; says Wytmar. &quot;Then you must acquire those skills and demonstrate the ability to handle broader responsibilities.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt154" id="ftnt_ref154">[154]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What are the attributes required to become significant in any job? There are many, and they are well known: punctuality, orderliness, systematic functioning, a capacity to make decisions, a willingness to delegate authority and responsibility, an ability to communicate clearly and pleasantly and to motivate people, self-discipline and self-restraint, cooperation with others, loyalty, integrity, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. </span><span class="c2">Recognizing strengths</span><span class="c3">. All managers possess certain of these attributes in some measure, and by virtue of these qualities, they have reached their present positions. Exercising one&#39;s existing capacities is living, but it is no way to grow. Expressing a known ability is acting out of habit. It is easy and gratifying, but not challenging and energizing. It is energy that makes for growth and advancement, and energy comes from the effort to release latent capacities and to acquire new skills, not to repeat what one already does well. People who always seek out opportunities to express their present skills may be very successful at the present level, but they are likely to remain there. Their bosses may even openly say, &quot;You are the only one who does this work well. I cannot afford to let you go to any other job.&quot; Such people have the satisfaction of knowing they are appreciated and wanted, not the challenge of growth and the opportunity for advancement. In other words, progress comes from developing new capacities rather than exercising old ones.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. </span><span class="c2">Identifying weaknesses</span><span class="c3">. Developing new skills and capacities is not enough for continuous progress. One must also continuously seek to overcome one&#39;s present weaknesses. Knowledge of your strengths must be balanced by a knowledge of your weaknesses as well. As most people like to exercise their existing talents, they also like to avoid doing anything they are not good at. Often they do so under the excuse, &quot;That work does not suit me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Weaknesses are of many types. Each one corresponds to an absence of a positive attribute listed above. Some people are perennially late; others, notoriously sloppy. Some have disorderly desk drawers; others, disorderly minds. Some are lax with their subordinates; others are lax with themselves. Some are poor communicators; others never stop talking. Some are too harsh in dealing with people; others are too soft. Some do whatever is asked of them even when they know it is wrong; others do not like to follow an instruction even when they know it is right. Some insist on doing by themselves work they should delegate; others delegate responsibilities that they should look after themselves. Some managers ignore the genuine personal problems of their sub-ordinates; others get too personally involved to be effective managers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There are many other weaknesses that directly undermine efficient functioning and prevent a person from advancing. Any and all of them can be removed by a determined effort. When even a single new skill is acquired and one weakness is removed, individual energy and performance increase enormously and the person moves up in the organization, usually several levels at a time and far beyond all expectations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Psychological effort</span><span class="c3">. Becoming significant is not just a question of working hard or being busy all the time. Almost everyone is busy all the time doing something or other. The effort required here is to work always at the highest level possible rather than simply putting in long hours doing routine work. It is more a psychological effort than a physical one. It requires a constant exertion of the will, not just the muscles. It involves exercising control over one&#39;s own temperamental traits, restraining unwanted behaviors, and making the effort to act in the most appropriate manner. It demands discipline of old habits and active initiative to acquire fresh ones. It involves becoming better informed, thinking things through before you act, and making decisions expeditiously. When people work hard physically, their present functioning improves. When they make a psychological effort, they rise to a higher level of functioning.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Elements of Enduring Success</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The task of managing a multinational corporation involves managing the components of which the company consists&mdash;ideas, organization, systems, skills, technology, finance, products, and markets. The task of managing a division of that corporation involves managing exactly the same components; only the quantities and degree of responsibility may differ. The same is true of managing a department of the division. At all levels, from the very top to the very bottom of an organization, the components of management are the same.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Each of these components consists of several subunits. Ideas include beliefs, values, missions, objectives, standards, policies, plans, and attitudes. Organization consists of departments and the people within them, hierarchy and authority, rules and regulations, and so forth. When all of these subunits are analyzed further, they can finally be reduced to certain basic, essential elements of management&mdash;time, people, information, money, machines, materials, and energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Regardless of the level of the organization, these are the essential elements, and effective management of them requires certain capacities. These capacities are defined by the corporate values referred to in Chapter 3. For convenience they are repeated here:</span></p><table class="c69"><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Physical</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Organizational</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c11">Psychological</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Cleanliness</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Discipline</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Respect for the individual</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Orderliness</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Freedom</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Pleasing the customer</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Punctuality, regularity</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Motivation</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Harmony (family feeling)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Efficient use of money and materials</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Standardization</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Decisiveness</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Maintenance of equipment</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Systemization</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Integrity</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Quality of product, service, or work</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Coordination</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Loyalty, trust</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Maximum utilization of time</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Integration</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Commitment</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Optimum utilization of space</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Communication</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Personal growth</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c45"><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Safety</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Cooperation (teamwork)</span></p></td><td class="c27" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c16"><span class="c3">Service to society</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The values of a department and the values of a corporation are the same. In the last analysis, what do individual managers do? They strive to be clean and orderly, to be punctual and use the time available in the most efficient manner, to conserve materials, to utilize space properly, to maintain equipment, to improve quality in every aspect of work, to function systematically, to coordinate with colleagues, to integrate with those at higher and lower levels of the organization, to minimize expenditures, to discourage negative behavior and encourage positive behavior among subordinates, to serve customers, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The same values that govern the company, the division, and the department govern the conduct of all managers in carrying out their jobs. Corporate values, departmental values, and individual values are the same. For the manager of a department, that department is the company, and the manager is the CEO of that department. The manager&#39;s task is to manage corporate values within the department. The manager&#39;s position is exactly analogous to that of the CEO outlined in Chapter 3. The manager has to accept those values, decide to implement them, create a suitable structure for implementation, define performance standards for each value, design or operate systems to achieve the standard, recruit the appropriate people and impart the necessary skills for implementing the values, coordinate and integrate activities, communicate with subordinates, and relate realization of the values to the personal growth and fulfillment of each person in the department. All that has been said in this book about the company applies to the individual as well. Value implementation begins with the CEO and ends with every individual in the company. Every person who identifies with the values of the corporation and strives to implement them can become a significant individual in the life of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">There is no capacity that is required for management beyond what is embodied in these corporate values. There is no work that cannot be accomplished through them. The task of all managers is to manage the organizational resources put at their disposal&mdash;including their own time, ideas, systems, people, decisions, skills, and so on&mdash;as well as they possibly can. Those that strive to personalize the corporate values as values in their own life and for their own personal growth find themselves identified with the psychic center of the corporation, one with it in value. Their actions are closely attuned to the corporate objectives. Their personal attitudes are in harmony with the attitudes of the corporation. Their personal growth is linked to the growth of the company. As it rises, they rise. As it becomes successful, they become significant. The more they give of themselves for the benefit of the company, the more valuable and significant they become in it. The more sincerely they serve it, the more rapidly they rise within it. They do what was done by IBM&#39;s CEO, John Opel, who &quot;achieved the top post by molding himself to be just what the company wanted, because that is exactly what he wanted too.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt155" id="ftnt_ref155">[155]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;And if by circumstance these individuals find themselves within a company that is not willing to grow or appreciate their service, they find greater opportunities calling them elsewhere. They continue to rise, even if the company does not.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Unforgettable Moments</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Take an ordinary day at work. The boss calls you in to find out how things went wrong or why the target has not been reached. Your sub-ordinates question your instructions, and your colleagues criticize your decisions. Your assistant tells you that your most original idea is merely &quot;all right.&quot; An important customer complains about slow delivery or poor service.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What if all these ordinary moments could be converted into great ones? Suppose your assistant, who never appreciates any of your ideas, comes forward to say they are &quot;wonderful.&quot; Suppose your boss calls you in to praise you for a job well done. Suppose your colleagues commend all your decisions, and your subordinates execute them with enthusiasm. Then ordinary moments become unforgettable; work becomes fresh and fulfilling. Life becomes rich and rewarding. You become a center of intensity. For that, there is a process&mdash;the process of translating values into actions in one&#39;s own life.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Putting Values to Work</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Values are the criteria by which we measure the quality of our actions. In the individual as in the company, there are a series of stages through which we pass in the process of fully establishing any value in our lives. The process of value implementation in a company is analogous to the process of personal growth in an individual. In both cases the personality develops, becomes more organized, better utilizes its capacities, and expresses them more effectively in action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Consider, for example, a simple corporate value like punctuality. &quot;Punctuality,&quot; says the proverb, &quot;is the soul of business.&quot; Without it, service cannot be prompt, efficiency cannot be high, prices cannot be low, and profitability cannot be maximized. As obvious as this may sound, punctuality&mdash;in starting work, attending meetings, completing schedules, answering letters, returning phone calls, producing products, attending sales calls, shipping goods, invoicing customers, maintaining accounts, and paying bills&mdash;is not so very common as one might think. A recent issue of General Mills&#39; </span><span class="c9 c11">Family</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;magazine dramatized this point with an article entitled &quot;What Time Does a 10 O&#39;clock Meeting Start?&quot; It requires a comprehensive and perpetual effort of the entire organization to maintain this one simple corporate value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Punctuality is a value as important for a manager as it is for a company and as difficult to establish and maintain. For instance, take Bill, a fictional but typical manager representative of many we know. Bill commutes by train 40 miles into New York every morning and consistently arrives 10 to 15 minutes late. One day he finally gets tired of displeasing his boss and being laughed at behind his back. He decides to make it a point to arrive on time. To do so, he has to catch the next earlier train, which leaves his hometown 30 minutes before his present train. For that, he has to wake up and shower a half-hour earlier, too, which just happens to coincide with the time his wife takes her bath. She agrees to readjust. Under the new schedule, Bill&#39;s wife is bathing while he is dressing, and there is no one to cook his breakfast, so he has to get up even earlier to scramble the eggs. By the second or third day, he is feeling quite fatigued from losing 45 minutes of sleep every night, and he sleeps right through the alarm. Bill then realizes that he must adjust his bedtime and retire earlier in order to get enough sleep, which requires a number of adjustments with his wife and children regarding dinnertime, keeping the TV volume down, and other family matters. After a week he really wonders whether it is worth such an effort and inevitably decides that it is not.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">What Bill failed to observe was that his effort made him more alert and brisk during the day, a better listener in meetings, a little faster with the paperwork. He had activated his will to achieve a goal and been energized by the endeavor. Had he persisted and extended the discipline of punctuality to other areas of his work like attending meetings and replying to letters, he would have found his overall efficiency raised by 5 percent to 10 percent. All his colleagues and subordinates would have been commenting that he was a &quot;changed person,&quot; without being able to pinpoint what was actually different.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Twelve Steps to Significance</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Fortunately, our manager decides to try again with greater determination in order to establish punctuality in his life. His effort takes him through the following stages.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">1. Until his boss started to complain and his colleagues began to joke with him about always being late, Bill was not even aware of his own deficiency. Previously he had thought that he was about as punctual as anyone else, but he now begins to notice that most other people are actually far more punctual than he is. Thanks to pressure from his boss and his peers, he gradually becomes conscious of the fact that lack of punctuality is one of his </span><span class="c9 c11">weaknesses</span><span class="c9">. He has acquired a new </span><span class="c9 c11">knowledge</span><span class="c3">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">2. After observing himself and others for some more time, he recognizes that punctuality is a far more important value than he had thought. He realizes that he must acquire it if he is to move up in the company. He feels a strong urge to overcome his deficiency, and he resolves to do so. He has made the </span><span class="c9 c11">decision</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to acquire a new value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">3. He speaks of this decision to his family and a few friends and is surprised when almost all of them laugh at his resolution. They are all sure he will soon forget it and remain the same old person. Their ridicule strengthens his resolve. He makes a promise to himself that he will become punctual. He has converted his decision into a firm </span><span class="c9 c11">commitment of his will</span><span class="c3">, and he begins to practice his resolution seriously.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">4. The more he thinks about his past behavior, the more he realizes how many problems and how much tension are generated by this one bad habit. The very thought of overcoming it makes him feel happier. Each time he succeeds in being on time, he feels a sense of accomplishment and greater confidence. He is exhilarated by the challenge of becoming a punctual person, and his </span><span class="c9 c11">enthusiasm</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is released for the effort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">5. One day, after complimenting himself for arriving at work ten minutes early, he sees a note on his calendar reminding him to file his quarterly department report the following day. He has not even begun to draft it. It suddenly dawns on him that punctuality is a value that applies to every aspect of his work, not just arriving at the office and attending meetings on time. He decides to draw up a list of each recurring task he has&mdash;like replying to letters, filing travel expense reports, and returning phone calls&mdash;and he establishes a </span><span class="c9 c11">standard</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for completing each one of them within a stipulated time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">6. During the first week of his effort, our manager stays at the office every night until 8:00 or 9:00 working on the day&#39;s correspondence and other tasks that he could not complete during normal working hours. He realizes this cannot go on forever. He begins to examine his working day to find out how all his time is being spent and discovers that much of it is taken up by small talk with colleagues in the corridors, unscheduled intrusions by subordinates, and meetings that spill over the allotted time. He decides to eliminate all unnecessary distractions. Setting aside a fixed hour every day to answer correspondence, he issues orders that he not be disturbed during that period, except for urgent matters. When colleagues fail to end meetings at the appointed time, he promptly excuses himself&mdash;even in the middle of an interesting story about the CEO&#39;s troubles with his wife. When subordinates come in to complain endlessly about others, he disciplines himself to end the discussion quickly. He has learned to set </span><span class="c9 c11">rules and regulations</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;governing his own conduct in order to be punctual.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">7. By this time our manager has already become the talk of the whole division. He looks five years younger, walks briskly, needs less sleep, and thinks more clearly. But still he runs into problems maintaining punctuality on many occasions, such as when customers call on the phone, a colleague comes in to chat, or he has to write a report&mdash;reports were never his strong point. But gradually he discovers ways to handle phone calls politely in less time. He learns how to lead a casual conversation with colleagues onto a serious topic that is useful or bring the discussion to a quick end. He asks a friend to help him improve in report writing. He acquires new </span><span class="c9 c11">skills</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;needed to implement his value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">8. Though vastly improved, he still finds he is late to 25 percent of meetings and behind schedule on work 30 percent of the time. He realizes that he needs to organize his entire day more carefully and develop means to complete his work more quickly. He works out </span><span class="c9 c11">systems</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;for processing mail, issuing instructions, delegating tasks, and receiving reports. His productivity improves dramatically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">9. His own routine work is now under fairly good control. But when it comes to work with his boss, subordinates, and colleagues, things do not fit into his systems. His assistants keep interrupting him to deal with their problems. His colleagues keep calling him at unscheduled times to discuss interdepartmental affairs. He asks his boss to allot him a specific appointment several times a week to discuss the affairs of his department. He decides to allot 15 minutes at a fixed hour every day for each of his assistants to meet him to discuss their work. He arranges a regular 30- minute meeting with colleagues once a week to discuss subjects of mutual concern. He has </span><span class="c9 c11">coordinated</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;his systems with the activities of colleagues and </span><span class="c9 c11">integrated</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;them with the activities of people working over and under him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">10. By now he is able to achieve his standard for punctuality 80 percent to 90 percent of the time. He finds that he no longer has to rely so much on rules and systems to be prompt. He always makes a conscious effort to be punctual in everything he does. The value has become </span><span class="c9 c11">institutionalized</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;as part of his behavior, something he always expects and demands of himself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">11. After some time, he finds that he no longer has to strain himself and struggle to be on time. He notices that punctuality has become a customary way of behaving, something he accepts as an essential part of doing his job properly. Even when his boss is away on a trip, he continues to maintain punctual behavior and succeeds 90 percent of the time. By now he has become known as a serious worker, an upcoming star, a man who is going places in the organization. His whole department functions briskly. Work flows smoothly. Productivity reaches a new high.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">12. One day he suddenly realizes that he never thinks of being punctual any more. It has become natural to his way of functioning. But he also has become less rigid and obsessive in his concern for being on time. He has noticed that often the most wonderful opportunities come as an interruption precisely at the moment when he is striving to keep to a schedule. He realizes that punctuality is only one among many corporate values and that sometimes it has to be sacrificed to others that are more important. When his assistant comes in with a very serious personal problem, he puts away his watch and forgets his schedule. When a customer gives him a very good idea for a new product, he cancels three meetings in order to follow it up at once. Our manager has made the value of punctuality one of his own </span><span class="c9 c11">personal values</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and integrated it with the other important values of his personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our manager, who less than half a year before was being laughed at by his peers and scolded by his boss, is now a different person. His efficiency has vastly increased. He feels younger, more energetic and alive. His work is no longer a pressure or a strain. It has become a constant source of enjoyment. Like Duke and Geneen, he goes to sleep every night eager for morning and for another day to begin. By the way, do not look for him in his old office anymore. He was called long ago to a higher job, where he is now struggling to acquire another one of the company&#39;s most important corporate values.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These are the stages the manager passed through in acquiring the new value:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. He became conscious of his weakness and acquired knowledge of the importance of the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. He made a decision to adopt the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. He made a commitment of his will to express the value in his life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. His enthusiasm was released for the effort of acquiring the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. He established standards by which to evaluate his own performance with respect to the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">6. He devised rules and regulations for his own conduct to help him reach the standard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">7. He developed systems to organize his activities in order to achieve the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">8. He acquired the skills needed to implement the value.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">9. He coordinated and integrated his systematic activities with those around, above, and below him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">10. He maintained the value by a constant, conscious effort in everything he did, no longer needing a particular system for support. He acquired an institutionalized behavior of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">11. He no longer had to struggle or strain to implement the value. It became a customary habit in all his work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">12. He identified with the value as a personal one in his own life and naturally sought to express it in everything he did. It had become an integral part of his personality.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Odyssey Continues</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This apparently herculean achievement of becoming punctual is actually only the starting point of our manager&#39;s quest for significance. He has discovered the process and acquired some experience. He begins to understand himself, his companions, and the company better. The way opens before him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By this time our manager is being talked about around the company as a truly exemplary person for his punctuality. He feels gratified and better for the effort. But in the process he has become aware of so many other areas in his work personality that need improvement. After all, punctuality is only a physical value, while he is working in a social environment where social skills and values are important. He also sees that to really perfect punctuality, he has to develop other capacities as well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One important area he has identified is communication. He has discovered, in the course of trying to manage time better, that he manages communication very poorly. For one thing, it always seems to take twice or three times as long for him to give instructions to subordinates or explain a point to colleagues as it takes others he has observed. Gradually he becomes aware that he is a perpetual repeater. He never feels he has fully communicated his point until he has repeated it three, four, or five times and notices his subordinates on the edges of their chairs or his colleagues rising to leave the room. He not only repeats a lot but often raises his voice very loud in order to emphasize a point. He begins to realize that the less sure he is of what he is saying, the louder he tends to speak; and the less clear he is about an idea, the more he tends to repeat it, as if to clarify it in his own mind by repetition to others. He also has observed that the president of his company is very soft-spoken, a man of few words, but those words carry a clarity, determination, and power for implementation. The manager vows to acquire this value, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Anyone who meets our manager a few months later is amazed at the change. By a serious effort he has almost stopped repeating himself. He has read a few books on communication, attended a brief course on discussion skills, and practiced diligently. He has instructed his colleagues and subordinates to remind him whenever he starts to repeat and whenever he raises his voice above the normal level. He finds that people listen to him more closely than before and follow his instructions better. He has been able to reduce the time of an average meeting by 30 percent to 40 percent, making it much easier for him to stick to his time schedule. He works more efficiently and thinks with greater clarity. His boss has even commended the brevity and precision of his explanations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The manager has made significant gains in this area by a strenuous, constant effort. He has become conscious of more and more areas where he should improve in order to communicate effectively. He discovers that his communication skills are better when his desk is orderly and his thoughts are well organized. He notices at times that when he is too casual, lax, and informal with his subordinates, they do not listen carefully. When he maintains a certain distance, communication is more effective. At other times he sees that when he is in an irritable or angry mood, it disturbs the communication process. People respond more to his mood than to his words, so he struggles to control himself and be more pleasant. A proper blend of friendliness and seriousness seems to work best. He has found that a simple act of communication depends on many other values, like orderliness, authority, self-control, pleasant behavior, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our manager also discovers to his surprise that often he does not listen to what other people are saying, and the discussion gets prolonged and confused by his lack of attention and receptivity. He finds that many mistakes are avoided, time is saved, and problems are caught before they become serious when he disciplines himself to be a good listener. For all the improvement, he still admires the great ability of his CEO to accomplish work effectively with far fewer words, in less time, and with greater ease than he himself is capable of.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Sometime later when you seek out the manager, you learn he has again been promoted. He receives you very pleasantly in his new office, asks about your affairs, replies briefly and clearly to your questions in a relatively low voice, appears cheerful and relaxed during the discussion yet serious and businesslike even so. He not only listens closely to what you say but has acquired the capacity to look at things from your point of view rather than his own. He anticipates your concerns and evokes a strong sense of trust and confidence in his relationship with you. He has a new poise about him, a confidence and an energy that mark him as an unusual individual. You learn from one of his subordinates that he is looked up to by his staff and has vastly improved the performance of the department since he took over.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Although we have abridged the narration of how the manager so dramatically raised the quality of communication in his work, he had to pass through all the 12 stages he completed earlier to become punctual. The only difference in this case was that he had more confidence in his ability to change and accepted the challenge with greater enthusiasm. He also saw much more dramatic results in his work because he was now striving to acquire a social value rather than a physical one.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Further Adventures</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the course of this effort, our manager has stumbled upon an earthshaking discovery about himself. He realizes that he does not know how to make decisions. His capacity for decision making is even less developed than his capacity for punctuality was when he began his effort at self-improvement. By now he also realizes that upgrading performance on a psychological value like decision making is far more difficult than improving performance on a physical or social one. But he also knows that the results of succeeding will be far more dramatic, both for his career and for his personal growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">With the experience gained so far, he proceeds to observe himself very closely in this realm and uncovers an area where he is completely disorganized and chaotic&mdash;his thoughts. He notices that each time a situation is presented to him for a decision, his first tendency is always the same&mdash;to postpone. Over the years he has acquired a whole array of very rational-sounding reasons for not making decisions. One of his favorites is, &quot;I don&#39;t have enough information.&quot;</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt156" id="ftnt_ref156">[156]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;He is surprised one day to come across a remark by Lee Iacocca that &quot;most managers have too much information.&rdquo; Suddenly he realizes that lack of information is usually just an excuse for not making a decision. He also finds that he has a tendency to delegate to his subordinates decisions that he should really make himself, not out of a desire to help them develop but out of an inability to decide for himself. He hears one day that his boss had permitted a programmer in the computer department to select a $500,000 computer for the division, which turned out to be a very poor choice. When the mistake was finally recognized a year later, it cost the company several million dollars in terms of lost productivity and consulting fees to rectify it. The manager resolves not to make the same mistake himself.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The manager&#39;s desire to be more punctual has prompted him to become a better communicator and a better decision maker. In the process he has learned to save an enormous amount of time. Each value depends on and supports the others.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our manager passes through several of the stages described earlier and by a very intensive effort achieves a moderate level of success. He has discovered that decision making is a skill that can be acquired by training. He also discovers that there is a system for it, a mental system, which can be developed by writing down the issues and the facts required to decide and taking action to gather the necessary facts. This clarity of thoughts enables him to abridge many long meetings with subordinates to a few minutes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Our manager has become far more decisive, yet in the process has uncovered another problem. Decision making not only requires information and clarity of thought; it demands a strong will, too. He finds that often he hesitates to make a decision that affects a subordinate because he lacks the strength to carry it out. He learns that confusion and indecisiveness often mask weakness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Fortunately, his efforts to date have already made him a far stronger, more confident, and more energetic person. He has learned that each time he exercises his will to make a greater effort, more energy is released, and he grows a little stronger. So, applying the same principle, he makes a tremendous effort to decide issues according to what he knows is right, even when it presents difficulties for him in execution. He sees that often he has told a small lie or permitted someone to suffer unfairly or has done something he knew was not really honest because he lacked the strength to be completely true to his convictions. Though the effort is enormously difficult, he feels a wonderful sense of relief, fulfillment, and joy, because he is doing the right thing and he is becoming a better person.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When we last saw our manager, by prior appointment in his executive office, the experience was quite overwhelming. He was very open, friendly, relaxed, and personable. Though he assumed no airs or formality, he exuded confidence and strength. When he looked at you, his eyes were direct and penetrating, with a sparkle of life in them. He laughed easily and spoke softly, but warmly. Though he said only a few words, his every gesture and expression conveyed his meaning and intentions. When confronted by a subordinate with an important decision, he paused for a moment to review the facts, gave an instruction, and returned to the conversation as if nothing had intervened. He was alert, cheerful, fully alive. His being radiated a calm joy and quiet intensity. We knew we were in the presence of a very significant individual.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Driving Force</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process we have described here with respect to three important corporate values can be repeated for them all. Although it may take a long time for some people to express a single new value in their behavior, those who apply themselves very seriously can accomplish it in a month. Managers who attempt it may observe that in the process they are acquiring many other values in greater measure, too. If they make a similar effort to express other corporate values as well, they will find that in the process those capacities they already possess will become more perfect.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The growth of a company like Apple from $1 million in sales in 1977 to $1.5 billion in 1984 required an enormous effort by countless individuals. The effort required is proportionate to the result desired. If a person wants to rise ten levels higher within a company, the effort he or she must make is tenfold greater than before. Normally, people and companies make such efforts only in times of crisis to preserve their jobs or avert bankruptcy. This is what Lee Iacocca and Chrysler Corporation did in the early 1980s. Had Chrysler made the same effort earlier, the crisis would never have arisen in the first place.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">According to Rick Wytmar, an executive search consultant, there has been a 30 percent reduction of middle management positions in the United States over the past ten years. Therefore, he urges managers to make the effort to improve their productivity and become indispensable in the face of increasing competition for their jobs. An effort based on insecurity and fear can certainly generate results. But the moment the sense of insecurity is removed, the effort will cease, because it is only a reaction to pressure from outside. A negative motive like fear cannot sustain a long-term effort for personal growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The effort to become a significant individual can also be motivated by a drive for personal achievement, by ambition. If managers are truly convinced of the results that can be obtained, they may make the enormous effort required. The material results will be substantial, but the effort itself will be tedious and exhausting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most favorable motive for making this effort is a desire to become a better person. When the driving force in the individual is an urge for personal growth and self-improvement, the experience becomes self-rewarding and self-motivating, independent of what other people say or do about it. It has been said, &quot;If you want to raise a child, be prepared to be exhausted for five years.&quot; The process will be like that, exhausting but fully enjoyable and fulfilling in itself.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Choice</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every person has a capacity to improve, sometimes vastly. The one essential thing is to really want it. It is up to each individual to choose. Many managers live a casual, carefree, relaxed existence that others may joke about behind their backs&mdash;one in which they continuously accommodate to the wishes of their subordinates, friends, and family, always adjusting to others, never deciding or willing for themselves, playful in their behavior, but often unhappy and insecure within. The alternative is a life of challenge and effort and continuous accomplishment, a briskness of energy, alertness of mind, clarity of thought&mdash;to be one who is respected by subordinates as an example to be followed, one who is supported by family members with ready cooperation, one whose natural disposition is happiness and whose normal reward in life is success.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Those who do make the effort find that their professional life and private life are no longer separated by an artificial barrier of time or conflicting commitments. They reinforce and support each other and become integrated. The energy, freshness, and strength these individuals acquire in work spills over and removes much of the tension, flatness, and conflict in their personal lives as well. They become better people at home as well as at the office, better parents and spouses as well as better managers. It is not their work alone that is improved and uplifted, but their whole lives that are raised to a higher level of intensity and satisfaction. They become more significant individuals in the companies they work for and in their homes, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Becoming a significant individual means identifying yourself fully with whatever work you do and giving yourself totally to it. The process of accomplishing the work and the process of improving yourself are the same. As Chris Steiner, of General Mills, said: &quot;I think the biggest obstacle we can run into a lot of times is ourselves. It really demands a lot of energy. To do your job well, you really have to put a lot of yourself into it.&quot; It involves a commitment, an act of self-giving. As Sue Espinosa said: &quot;You really get involved at Apple. You don&#39;t mean to, but you really do.&quot; And the result? John Machuzick, of General Mills, summed it up best: &quot;I love it!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Earlier in this chapter we stated that in most companies the significant individual is the CEO. We can add here that anyone who makes the effort to become significant can become a CEO. If the company is stagnant, he or she rises to the top levels. If the company is growing, the individual grows with it until he or she acquires the level of authority and responsibility that the CEO once possessed at an earlier stage of the company&#39;s development.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Role of the Individual in Corporate Success</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">When managers make this effort, it is not their personal progress alone that is the result. The entire work for which they are responsible is energized and becomes more productive. They have attuned themselves to the central values of the corporation; therefore, the decisions they make and the actions they initiate are more likely to be in harmony with the overall direction of the company. They have discovered and developed their own inner capacities; therefore, they will be better able to identify and develop the hidden talents of their subordinates. &quot;A superior who works on his own development sets an almost irresistible example,&quot; as Drucker said.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt157" id="ftnt_ref157">[157]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;They release inner springs of energy from their own personalities and express it in their work; therefore, they will be better able to release the energy of their subordinates, to excite and enthuse them, to help them grow, and to channel their energy into work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The relationship between individual growth and enduring corporate success has been noted before. Tom Watson, Jr., wrote in </span><span class="c9 c11">A Business and Its Beliefs</span><span class="c3">:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">I believe the real difference between success and failure in a corporation can very often be traced to the question of how well the organization brings out the great energies and talents of its people.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt158" id="ftnt_ref158">[158]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The key to enduring corporate success is not to imitate Japan but to release the unlimited potentials of an organization&#39;s greatest resource&mdash;its people. The effort of individuals within a company to grow is the most powerful and lasting impetus for the growth of the company itself. As Drucker put it:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Self-development of the effective executive is central to the development of the organization.&hellip;As executives work towards becoming effective, they raise the performance level of the whole organization. They raise the sights of people&mdash;their own as well as others&#39;.</span><sup class="c9"><a href="#ftnt159" id="ftnt_ref159">[159]</a></sup></p><p class="c4" id="h.396th5hvst1p"><span class="c3">A company that recognizes the unlimited reservoir of energy and talents it possess in its people and takes the personal growth of every individual within the company as a central value of the corporation will be constantly enlivened, invigorated, and carried upward by the perpetual flow of fresh energies emanating from its people.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 12 - Energizing the Corporation</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">People have the capacity to stand by nonchalantly witnessing a miracle, then walk away as if nothing unusual had ever happened, taking the incredible for granted. That has been the typical response of managers to Chrysler&#39;s dramatic recovery. Everyone knows about it, appreciates it, and admires it, but how many really understand how it happened? Much attention has been given to Lee Iacocca&#39;s sudden rise to fame, the government loan guarantees and their early repayment, the success of the K-car and the minivan. But these are only the external trappings and results of a process that should be of intimate concern to all managers&mdash;the process by which corporations are energized and launched on the road to enduring corporate success. The facts surrounding Chrysler&#39;s remarkable achievement are known, but the process itself remains shrouded in a veil of obscurity and confusion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Of course, Chrysler&#39;s miracle is not the first or only one to occur in the American automotive industry. Sloan performed an equal or greater miracle at GM in 1920, when it was on the verge of succumbing to a crisis precipitated by the postwar recession. Sloan created a new, decentralized organizational structure at GM and performed magic in the marketplace. During the eight years from 1921 to 1928, the company&#39;s unit sales volume grew more than eightfold, and its market share increased from under 15 percent to over 45 percent. From then on GM has never looked back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Ford Motor Company performed an equally dramatic miracle after the Second World War, when Henry Ford II took over control of the ailing company, which had lost two-thirds of its market share over the previous 20 years and found its very survival in question. Within lO years Ford recovered its No. 2 position in the industry and was transformed into a major growth company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">These three miracles are all expressions of a single process, a process that governs the growth and development of every company, regardless of its size&mdash;the process by which corporations are energized and evolve. How is it that these companies, which were on the verge of extinction, were able to recover so rapidly and grow so dramatically after coming so close to collapse? Where did the energy come from to fuel their recovery? What was the mechanism they employed to convert a life-threatening problem into an opportunity for growth? In another year or two, Chrysler&#39;s accomplishment will become a part of history. While it is still fresh in our minds, it is worthwhile learning all the lessons it has to teach us.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">D&eacute;j&aacute; Vu</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A sudden fall in market demand had a devastating effect on the company, which was already plagued by poor-quality products and poor management. Manufacturing cars without dealer orders and in spite of the plummeting sales, the company accumulated enormous inventories of poor-quality cars on its lots. The company tried unsuccessfully to force the dealers to buy the unwanted stocks. Concerned bankers pressed for reform.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A new president was appointed. He cut the price on the unsold cars to clear the inventory, drafted outside talents to upgrade quality and improve design, persuaded creditors to wait and bankers to lend the company more money. Within five years all the outstanding debts were repaid, nine years before their due date. one journal called this remarkable recovery &quot;the biggest reclamation project the automobile industry has witnessed and practically the christening of a new business.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt160" id="ftnt_ref160">[160]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The new president was Walter Chrysler. The year was 1925.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Everyone knows the story of Chrysler under Lee Iacocca, when te company struggled for its survival between 1979 and 1984. But few people are aware of how this story mirrors the saga of Chrysler under its founder, Walter P. Chrysler, when the company struggled to be born between 1920 and 1925. These were the &quot;auspicious&quot; circumstances under which the corporation assumed its present name but inherited a past that it is still unable to shake off, even after 60 years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The crisis in 1920 and the crisis in 1980 are remarkably similar. In some essential way, Chrysler remains the same after 60 years of alternating growth and decay. The same corporate character and personality still preside over its destiny.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Crisis is a natural, though not an inevitable, part of growth. In Chrysler&#39;s case it was a birth sign and a ruling planet. The United States Motor Company, of which Chrysler is the ultimate descendant, was constituted in 1910, bringing together a number of independent car manufacturers, wistfully described as &quot;a collection of pronounced failures.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt161" id="ftnt_ref161">[161]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;The new conglomerate did not fare any better than its several parents. Two years later it declared bankruptcy. Soon afterward it re-emerged under the name Maxwell Motors, prospered briefly during the boom that followed World War I, and then collapsed along with the market in 1920.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Walter Chrysler was called in by the bankers to save the company, there were 26,000 unsold cars crowding company lots and freight yards. When Iacocca joined the company, there were around 80,000 unsold cars in what the company euphemistically called its &quot;sales bank,&quot; and the figure soon passed 100,000. Walter Chrysler instituted a policy of building cars only against firm orders from dealers, a system Iacocca had to reintroduce 60 years later. In 1920 the company had $33 million in debt obligations. Chrysler persuaded the bankers to lend it another $15 million. The company recovered so rapidly that all the debts were liquidated by January 1925, nine years ahead of schedule. A few months later Maxwell Motors was taken over by the newly christened Chrysler Motors Corporation, and the company was launched on a period of rapid growth that saw it reach the position of the nation&#39;s second largest automaker, a position it held until 1953.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the 1980s the debt was much bigger and the government was directly involved in saving the company, but here, too, the recovery was incredibly swift and the loan guarantees were retired seven years before they were due. Once again there was talk of a new Chrysler Corporation; although the name did not change this time, there was a widespread conviction that the nature of the company had somehow changed. However, the remarkable Chrysler Corporation was and still remains somewhat of a mystery.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Leaning Tower</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The origin of all Chrysler&#39;s problems through the decades was an imbalance in the constitution of the company resulting from the conditions of its birth and the personality of its founder. Unlike most leaders of large business in his day, Walter Chrysler rose from the ranks of manual labor. After graduating from high school, he declined an opportunity for a college education and went to work in a grocery store. How apropos was Iacocca&#39;s remark that Chrysler was still being run in 1978 &quot;like a small grocery store&quot;!</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt162" id="ftnt_ref162">[162]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Walter Chrysler became an apprentice machinist on the railways, then a mechanic, and eventually a superintendent. When he joined Buick as works manager in 1912, he brought to his new job his experience with large-scale metalworking for utilitarian purposes and introduced improved processes and greater efficiencies into the nascent auto industry. By 1916 he had become president of Buick where he remained for four years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler&#39;s humble origins and lack of education made it extremely difficult for him to appreciate the revolution in management and organization that was taking place. In keeping with his experience as a mechanic, Chrysler, like Ford, approached automaking as essentially an engineering job, to produce the best technical design most economically. He recruited talented engineers to create a company with &quot;an extraordinary engineering intelligence,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt163" id="ftnt_ref163">[163]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;placed heavy emphasis on research, and built up a strong tradition of technological innovation and engineering excellence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Technology is an inexhaustible resource. There are innumerable ways that technology can be improved, modified, or adapted to make it more competitive, to widen the existing market, or to create entirely new markets. Ford reduced the price of the automobile through technological innovations in production and thereby created a new market among those who could never before afford a car.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Chrysler technological innovations like the high-compression engine, hydraulic brakes, and automatic transmission provided a constant source of fresh energy to nourish the company&#39;s life and spur its growth. Over time, engineering excellence became the primary value, the mission of the company, which it pursued in preference to all other values.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But technology is only one of the key components of corporate existence and not, as Walter Chrysler believed, the only key. His strong bias for engineering was accompanied by a failure to develop the other essential components in equal measure&mdash;a failure that sometimes amounted to gross negligence. The potentials of technology were often tapped at the expense of the other components and to the detriment of harmony between them. As a result, the company developed in a partial and unbalanced manner. It grew into a leaning tower.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Technology for Technology&rsquo;s Sake</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The most visible effect of this imbalance was on Chrysler&#39;s approach to the market. The market contains unlimited potentials. It consists of all the needs, desires, interests, fashions, and fads of society. They are innumerable. There are basic physical needs like transporation, which can be met in an infinite variety of more convenient, comfortable, and attractive ways. There are also social needs, such as for recognition and status, which generate greater demand for material objects. There are psychological needs, as well, such as security or dominance, which create demand for products and services.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the early days of the automotive industry, the car was primarily a means of transportation that met a physical need for a faster, more convenient, more comfortable way to travel. The challenge faced by the car manufacturers was to produce the most mechanically advanced vehicle in the largest numbers at the lowest price.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But gradually a shift took place in the market. Having accommodated itself to the newfangled invention, the public started to look for more subtle refinements in styling and design. The automobile began to appeal to social needs for status and attention and psychological needs for power, a sense of self-importance, and even masculinity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">William Durant was one of the first to see this new trend. He conceived of a company that would manufacture a wide variety of cars that appealed to the public&#39;s social as well as physical needs. Durant created GM and gave it the mission to build cars for every purse and purpose. When he took over at GM, Sloan, too, recognized that styling had become the most important marketing consideration.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As Walter Chrysler was introducing his very first model, based on the new high-compression engine, Ford&#39;s Model T was nearing the end of its days. Chrysler understood that people wanted something new, but he thought they wanted new and improved technical design, when in fact what they wanted was new styling. In the mid-1930s the company introduced a new, aerodynamically designed model with the first automatic overdrive transmission. It was an engineering masterpiece but a marketing disaster. Chrysler was in tune with the latest advances of technology but already losing touch with the market.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler&#39;s bias for engineering rather than marketing considerations continued unabated after the Second World War. The company&#39;s management insisted on practical, mechanical advances with a &quot;disdain for whimsical fashion&quot; at exactly the time customers were eagerly awaiting new annual style changes.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt164" id="ftnt_ref164">[164]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Over the years, technology came to dominate market considerations. Engineering determined the size, styling, content, and cost of the cars that the company made. When Chrysler&#39;s management wanted to build a rear-engined compact in the late fifties to compete with GM&#39;s Corvair, the engineers refused, because they could not design one to meet their own standards of styling and comfort. The company&#39;s former chairman, Lynn Townsend, remarked, &quot;There was no way this management could have even ordered that engineering department to do a rear-engined car.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt165" id="ftnt_ref165">[165]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;In the late sixties, a similar fate befell plans for a subcompact. As recently as 1975 Townsend commented, &quot;The engineering department is the most dominant influence in this company.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt166" id="ftnt_ref166">[166]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;wrote at the time: &quot;Overreliance on engineering as the company&#39;s strategy has had calamitous consequences. Chrysler responds to its engineers&#39; inventions, not to the wants of its market.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt167" id="ftnt_ref167">[167]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Instead of developing new technology to meet a market need, Chrysler developed technology for the sake of technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The market was not the only thing that took a back seat to engineering at Chrysler. Organization did, too. Perhaps Walter Chrysler believed that building factories, making engines, and assembling cars were all there was to creating an organization, but that is far from the truth. Chrysler was essentially an engineer rather than a manager or an organizer. The company he built focused primarily on engineering design and assembly of parts produced by suppliers. Except for the engines, Chrysler did little manufacturing of its own in the early years. Even a managerial task like negotiating with the union was handed over to a law firm. The organization Chrysler created was small in size, simple in structure, similar to that of much smaller and less complex businesses, with himself and a few associates at the center personally managing all key operations. Chrysler was one of the early breed of empire builders, who, like Henry Ford, utilized vast material and human resources but &quot;had relatively little interest in devising schemes to assure a more efficient over-all management of these resources.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt168" id="ftnt_ref168">[168]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;In other words, Chrysler believed in the power of technology and production but ignored the enormous power of organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By contrast, Alfred Sloan was a builder of organizations. While Walter Chrysler was concentrating on technology, Sloan was building up a powerful, decentralized organization at GM with autonomous operating divisions coordinated and controlled by a centralized executive staff, interdivisional committees, and a sophisticated system of controls. Sloan did not have specialized technical talents, but he created an organization that attracted all the design, production, and marketing skills he himself lacked. GM&#39;s decentralized organizational structure became a pillar of strength for the company and a model for American business. Organization proved more powerful than technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the early 1950s both Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor Company attempted to reorganize along the lines Sloan had established at GM. Ford succeeded in great measure, although Henry Ford II perpetuated something of the autocratic tradition established by his grandfather.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By this time, Chrysler&#39;s organization had crystallized into a group of independent and isolated divisions, each in contact with the executive offices at the center but with little communication or coordination between them. The division heads possessed little authority and were responsible primarily for sales, purchasing, and cost control. There was no overall system for coordination, as at GM. The original corporate character was so well entrenched that it successfully resisted the attempt at reorganization. The net result was a move toward ever greater centralization of authority and control rather than decentralization&mdash;an organization held together by the strength of the chief executive rather than by internal cohesion. After Walter Chrysler&#39;s retirement, the organization lost the centripetal force that united its parts. It became what Iacocca termed &quot;these little states&mdash;duchies. They would not report to central authority.&hellip;Everybody had his own little empire. Twenty little companies and nobody to pull them together.&quot;</span><span class="c41 c71 c73">&nbsp;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt169" id="ftnt_ref169">[169]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The company did acquire a decentralized character, but it nearly lost the character of being an organization. Organization means first and foremost coordination, but at Chrysler everyone was &quot;working in a vacuum,&quot; as Iacocca remarked. &quot;All of Chrysler&#39;s problems really boiled down to the same thing: nobody knew who was on first. There was no team, only a collection of independent players.&hellip;&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt170" id="ftnt_ref170">[170]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">With or without a strong coordinating organization, the primary components of a company are indissolubly linked together and inter-dependent. The failure to fully develop the powers of organization ultimately had repercussions that seriously affected Chrysler&#39;s most precious possession, its reputation for engineering excellence. In the late 1950s and then again in the mid-1970s, the company was faced with a serious problem of poor quality. Many of the defects could be directly attributed to &quot;poor coordination between engineers and manufacturing&quot;&mdash;that is, lack of organization.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt171" id="ftnt_ref171">[171]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The original bias for engineering had introduced a crack in Chrysler&#39;s original organizational structure. As the company grew, the crack became wider, until it represented a nearly unbridgeable gulf between the different parts of the firm. The basic principle of a central organizational will directing and controlling all the parts was undermined from the start by the inordinate importance and freedom given to the engineering division.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Untapped People Power</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler not only failed to tap the potentials of the market and organization; it failed to release the boundless energies and talents of its people as well. People have an infinite capacity for development. They can be disciplined to work harder and more efficiently. They can be motivated to be enthusiastic and cooperative. They can take on greater responsibilities and exercise authority constructively. They can acquire greater knowledge and skill. They can become innovative and creative, loyal and dedicated. Their work can be made an opportunity for personal growth and fulfillment. When any of these potentials of people is enhanced, the productive power of the company increases enormously.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler failed at the very first step&mdash;discipline. Executives using the president&#39;s office as a passageway from one office to another and factory workers who do not bother to use the trash barrels for their garbage are clear signs that the most rudimentary form of discipline is lacking. Iacocca called it &quot;a state of anarchy.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt172" id="ftnt_ref172">[172]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler&#39;s ideas on labor relations were as outdated as its concept of organization. Long after the UAW was an established power in Detroit, recognized and accepted by GM and Ford, Chrysler refused to cooperate with the union. The bitter feelings generated in the early days set the tone for the labor unrest that pursued Chrysler in later years. Absenteeism, low morale, racial tensions, disputes between workers and managers, and wildcat strikes were more common than at GM and Ford. These recurring problems seriously affected the efficiency of operations and the quality of the cars. Workers at one plant failed to punch in and out for lunch hour and then broke the time clocks when management insisted. As one UAW official commented, &quot;Inside the Chrysler plants there was just about every kind of problem you could imagine&quot;&mdash;theft, gambling, protection rackets, prostitution, and even a murder.</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt173" id="ftnt_ref173">[173]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The absence of a strong central authority made it difficult to control people and impossible to harness their full capacities for productive work. Talented individuals were assigned to jobs that they had not been trained for. Potential talents were ignored or suppressed rather than being actively encouraged. A rich pool of human resources was neglected for want of an organization to develop it.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Unmined Wealth</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the absence of a well-developed organization, the productive potentials of capital cannot be mobilized. The efficient use of money by elimination of unnecessary and wasteful expenditure is one way to release its productive power. The use of cost accounting to determine the optimal pattern of investment and the precise gain or loss from each activity is another. But these potentials relate only to the use of money. There are also creative financing techniques that make capital available far more readily than in the past&mdash;techniques like lease-purchase, credit cards, venture capital, stock offerings, bonds, and so forth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler neglected its financial potentials as much as it did its human and organizational ones. Until 1957, when a comprehensive cost-control program was introduced, one division head complained that he could not find out the cost of the cars built by his division. Twenty years later Iacocca found that there was still no overall system of financial controls.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The productive potential of creative financing techniques was dramatically demonstrated in the sixties. In 1962 Chrysler introduced the first 5-year or 50,000-mile warranty, at a time when Ford and GM offered only 12 months or 12,000 miles. Two years later Chrysler Credit Corporation was established to provide funds to dealers and retail customers. Between 1962 and 1968 the company&#39;s market share in the United States grew from 10.3 percent to 18.1 percent, and sales tripled, from $2.5 billion to $7.4 billion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The impressiveness of this achievement is only mitigated by the fact that GM had established a similar credit organization 43 years earlier, in 1919, and Ford had followed suit in 1950. The gains made by Chrysler in the sixties from creative financing could have come much sooner and been cumulatively much greater if only it had imitated what had proved successful for its competitors long before.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The company&#39;s greatest error with regard to finance was to intensively pursue profit as a short-term goal, producing cars it did not need in order to meet budget targets, juggling figures to make it look as if cars in the sales bank had actually been sold, adjusting accounts to conceal the financial weaknesses of the company, and sacrificing long-term investments and essential R&amp;D expenditures to boost present profits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Of course, the greatest error a company can make is to run out of cash. And Chrysler did this several times&mdash;once as the United States Motor Company; once as Maxwell Motors; again in 1958, when it had to rush to the banks for a $120 million emergency credit line; and yet again in 1979. Each time disaster had been averted it has returned in far greater proportions, until finally only the U.S. government could save the company from collapse. If the cycle is allowed to repeat, next time even the government may not be able to help.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Second Resurrection</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This was the constitution of Chrysler when Lee Iacocca became president. Its problems were gargantuan and seemingly insurmountable. The company owed $1.3 billion, had no cash, and, in the collective opinion of Chrysler and its bankers, its assets could not be sold for anywhere near the amount of its debts. As if this were not enough of a problem, there were others: some 100,000 unsold cars valued at $600 million in the sales bank that were poorly made and deteriorating outdoors; enormous overheads and declining sales that were generating millions in losses every day; a dissatisfied and alienated customer base, which was discouraged from further purchases by the growing public conviction that the company would not survive long enough to service its own warranties; and an undisciplined, demoralized work-force frightened by the specter of unemployment. The voice of the financial experts was nearly unanimous. Chrysler will not survive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler not only survived the crisis but posted one of the most incredible recoveries in corporate history. The company that had lost $1.7 billion in 1980, the largest loss of any corporation till that time, earned an estimated $2.4 billion in 1984, more than it had earned in all of the previous 59 years of its existence. When Chrysler made a stock offering in early 1983, the entire 26 million shares, with a market value of $432 million, were sold within an hour. The company&#39;s stock, which had fallen below $4 a share a year earlier, rose to $36 a few weeks after the offering.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">How was such a dramatic recovery possible? Where did the energy and resources come from to accomplish it? What was the process by which a crisis was transformed into an opportunity for growth?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The simplest answer to these questions is to give all the credit to Lee Iacocca or the government&#39;s $1.5 billion in loan guarantees. Whenever we do not understand an event, it is easy to explain it away as the work of a genius or superhuman leader or the obvious result of the indomitable power of money.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">However great Iacocca&#39;s achievement, he frankly admits that he lacks either intellectual genius or superhuman power. The extraordinary thing about him is the commitment and effort he made and the good commonsense knowledge of organization he exhibited. Iacocca is a hardworking, dynamic, experienced automobile executive, a charismatic person with a keen sense of the market, but he is not, as he is the first to admit, a superman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As for the loan guarantees, certainly Chrysler would not have survived without them. But it would have been no surprise to anyone if the company had failed even after receiving them. In fact, it almost did. Eighteen months after the guarantees were issued, Chrysler ran out of cash&mdash;it came down to its last $1 million at a time when daily expenses were $50 million&mdash;and in 1980 and 1981 its total losses were $2.2 billion, which was more than the value of the guarantees. Money alone was certainly not the answer. Then what was?</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Steps to Success</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The steps taken by Iacocca at Chrysler, the changes made within the organization, and the dramatic reversal of the company&#39;s fortunes are expressions of the process we have been presenting in this book, the process by which corporations evolve. The advantage of examining a case like Chrysler&#39;s is that the enormous pressure of dire external circumstances forced the company to intensify its effort for change, so that the process was accelerated and is therefore easier to perceive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the previous chapter we stated that the individual is a microcosm of the organization. The process of individual growth is one of releasing and converting energy into productive power. That process begins with an awareness of a weakness to be overcome or a higher goal to be achieved. It commences with a decision by the individual to grow, a commitment of the will, and enthusiasm for the effort. Then it passes through several more stages, which culminate in the development of the individual&#39;s personality to incorporate new personal values.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Corporations are individuals, too. They develop inwardly in their capacity to generate, transmit, and utilize energies for productive work. The process that governs their development is the same as that which governs the development of the individual. It is the process by which personality grows.</span></p><p class="c12 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Knowledge</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The first step in that process is to acquire knowledge of the growth that needs to be achieved and of the weaknesses that have to be overcome. By weakness, we mean an inadequate or below-average capacity in some particular area, which has to be strengthened. Weaknesses occur in areas where the personality is not developed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But there are some personality defects that are the result of wrong development rather than no development, wrong organization rather than disorganization. The problems faced by Chrysler were not those of an immature corporate personality that had not yet developed a distinctive character. They were expressions of a personality that had developed, but developed in an asymmetrical manner. There was a formed character, but it was based on many bad corporate habits. Because the personality was developed, it was able to successfully resist the attempts to modify it in the 1950s.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca&#39;s immediate task at Chrysler was not to build up the organization, but to forcefully eradicate innumerable negative habits that had become entrenched. The first necessity was not soul-searching and self-scrutiny, but just plain discipline. Energies that were being squandered and resources that were being wasted had to first be brought under control before they could be utilized productively. A lack of discipline pervaded Chrysler, and the only possible remedy was &quot;a dose of order and discipline.&quot; </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt174" id="ftnt_ref174">[174]</a></sup></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Crucial Decision</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca&#39;s first act at Chrysler, and probably his greatest, was not his plant closings, cost cutting, or appeal to the government. It was a decision&mdash;a decision so momentous that it sapped all his energies and left hi &quot;seeing double.&quot; It was the decision to eliminate this lack of discipline, to remove the entrenched negative habits that had generated the crisis in the first place. Without that, no growth was possible, and even the company&#39;s survival was highly doubtful. That decision&mdash;made progressively as the true nature of Chrysler&#39;s problems became fully evident to Iacocca, reaffirmed and strengthened by each additional revelation of disorder, and solidified into a complete determination and commitment of his entire personality&mdash;was the indispensable prerequisite and essential seed of all that followed. Because the obstacles were so large and the resistance so great, nothing less than a total commitment commensurate with the weight of the task could be effective.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Once that decision had been fully made, it had to be communicated to all levels of the organization, accepted by them, and converted into a commitment of the entire management, and it had to generate a willingness and enthusiasm for change. Even Iacocca&#39;s total determination could not have been fully effective if he had attempted to fulfill it through authority alone, because the organization lacked the authority required to correct its own misguided course. Iacocca chose to rely on education and persuasion rather than force in order to enlist the sympathies of his people and convince them in turn to make commensurate decisions at their own levels to eliminate substandard behavior and poor performance. He succeeded in winning the support of his people and persuading them to confirm his decision in their own minds and actions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca&#39;s decision called forth all his energies and threw them into action. It also released the energies of those around him. He had not merely to communicate a decision to his associates; he had to inspire them with confidence, make them commit themselves, and release their energies and enthusiasm. The fact that many highly placed executives sacrificed secure positions at Ford and other companies to join Iacocca shows that he did succeed in releasing their enthusiasm for a challenge and an adventure. &quot;My mother was horrified when I left a good job at IBM to join Chrysler, and so were the mothers of some of the others who joined the Iacocca team at that time,&quot; recalled Frederick W. Zuckerman. Zuckerman joined Chrysler in October 1979 as assistant controller/financial controls and today is vice-president and treasurer. Walter Chrysler was known as an energetic and courageous risk taker. The tradition still lives at the company.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Revitalizing the Organization</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy was released by a decision and reinforced by the commitment of a determined management team. But in order to become effective, it had first to be converted into a force or will of the corporate character. The decision had to change the structure and functioning of the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This change was accomplished in several ways. The organization was restructured along more rational lines, eliminating such anachronisms as having a single executive responsible for both manufacturing and sales operations. Separate operations were isolated from one another so that they could be individually evaluated. There was a massive reshuffling of the organization chart. Nearly the entire executive team was replaced by new faces, mostly recruits from outside. Talented individuals were promoted from below, and an effort was initiated to uncover and encourage latent talents that had been suppressed by the old, encrusted organizational setup. Highly competent and trusted people were brought in to head priority operations like finance, quality control, and marketing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The reorganization instilled a sense of discipline at the higher levels of management, where it had been sorely lacking. New policies were instituted, new standards of performance were established, and new rules were formulated to eliminate the grosser violations of corporate self-restraint.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The sales bank for unsold car inventory had engendered a lack of discipline in the sales force, since production could continue even when orders flagged, and the cars could be stored in the sales bank until they were disposed of on a clearance sale. The abolition of the sales bank and the introduction of a make-to-order production policy forced the sales department to sell cars in order to keep the plants open instead of just to keep the sales bank from overflowing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A significant aspect of the reorganization involved closer coordination and greater cooperation with the UAW, necessitated by the requirement for union wage concessions in order for the company to qualify for the government loan guarantees. The appointment of the UAW president, Doug Fraser, to Chrysler&#39;s board marked a reversal of the company&#39;s historical efforts to distance itself as far as possible from the union. This reversal not only won the necessary wage concessions but also enabled the company, in cooperation with the union, to tighten labor discipline. For instance, they worked out new rules to reduce absenteeism at the plants. &quot;Putting Fraser on the Board was symbolic that we are all in this thing together,&quot; Zuckerman said.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The decision of the CEO and commitment of top management energized the company. The reorganization transformed that decision into a force for change. But in order for that force to be effective, new systems were required to convert force into organizational power.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One of the most basic of these systems was for reporting financial data. Discipline requires control, control depends on monitoring of activities, and monitoring is done most effectively through information systems. Those that existed earlier at Chrysler were incomplete and only partially operative. The new management insisted on analyzing the performance of each separate operation in terms of timeliness, quality, and financial viability. A comprehensive reporting system, a centralized system of financial controls, and a quarterly performance-review system were among those introduced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For conversion of this organizational power into corporate results, the company needed the right skills at the right place. But over the years Chrysler had developed the habit of shuffling managers so frequently that very few were found in positions they were actually qualified to manage. Iacocca found it necessary to fire or retire most of those who had been associated with lax operations and bring in strong, experienced executives to insist on disciplined functioning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">While elimination of undisciplined behavior was an essential prerequisite for any positive achievement, it represented only a part of the momentous decision Iacocca made and implemented. In moves of as great or even greater significance, he defined, communicated, and implemented several key values. Foremost among these values were quality of product, efficiency of production, punctuality of scheduling, coordination among departments, cooperation with dealers, and harmony with the market. The process of implementing each of these values followed the steps outlined earlier in this book.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Implementing Quality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler had been plagued by quality problems for years. Poor quality was taking a heavy toll on the company&#39;s market share and hiking up warranty costs. Everyone was aware that quality was a weakness. The decision to improve was essential to recovery. &quot;From day one, Iacocca drove home the message that you must never scrimp on quality,&quot; Zuckerman told us. &quot;Iacocca pounded this message over and over. It gave him a great opportunity to make a `Let&#39;s Win One for the Gipper&#39; speech, which he does very well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The first step was to evolve a strategy, the Quality Improvement Program, and then to create an organizational structure to implement it. Iacocca brought in a retired quality-control expert as a consultant, established a new department to oversee quality, and hired 250 people to staff it. In order for the program to be effective, many systems had to be introduced or upgraded. Purchasing was an area where quality control was very lax. Paul Bergmoser was hired away from Ford to head the department, and a team of skilled quality-control people was added to the purchasing department.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Many quality problems were introduced by the inordinately large number of parts the company used on its various models. New policies were introduced, which reduced the number of parts from 70,000 to 40,000, and a streamlined inventory system was installed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Poor quality also resulted from the lack of coordination between design and manufacturing. The designers were specifying parts that could not be produced. Systems for coordination between these two departments eliminated design errors before they became production defects. The company coordinated with the UAW on a quality-circles program that significantly reduced manufacturing errors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Independent studies undertaken before the quality program was introduced found that Chrysler typically had 30 percent more customer complaints than Ford or GM. As a result of the program, the quality of Chrysler&#39;s cars improved dramatically. Between 1978 and 1980, one study showed a 32 percent improvement by Chrysler. A confidential GM marketing report in 1980 indicated that customer satisfaction was higher at Chrysler than at any of its competitors. By 1983 Chrysler&#39;s warranty costs had fallen by 40 percent.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Implementing Punctuality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Another problem area had been delays in the introduction of new products. Punctual introduction of new models required precise timing, close coordination, and tight discipline from the point of conception to the completion of production. Punctual development timing was a priority value for the new management.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Specific standards were established and deadlines set for each phase of the development schedule. Standards had existed earlier, but they had often been ignored. Bergmoser called it &quot;a matter of discipline.&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt175" id="ftnt_ref175">[175]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;Now clear lines of authority and decision-making responsibility were established for approval of design concepts, and a master system was introduced to ensure proper coordination between all participating departments, especially design and production.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As a result of the development-timing program, new-product scheduling was radically improved. Three years is the standard development cycle for new models in the automotive industry, even when they do not involve major changes in the engine and transmission. In 1983 Chrysler released three new models on which the time from approval of design to release ranged between 6 and 12 months. Such quick reflexes were a direct result of the improved discipline and streamlined systems.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Implementing Efficiency</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The decision to acquire greater production efficiency was not a choice. It was a compulsion. It was compelled by the company&#39;s financial crisis. Discipline alone was not enough to achieve it. It required a comprehensive strategy for value implementation that touched every aspect of the company&#39;s functioning. It involved a major restructuring of the organization&mdash;the closing of 23 plants&mdash;a drastic reduction in the workforce and all levels of management, elimination of the sales bank, centralization of accounts payable (which was previously handled from 30 different offices), creation of oversight committees, reorganization of the controller&#39;s office, and other structural changes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The organizational will for greater efficiency was empowered by a multitude of systems that coordinated quality control, purchasing, inventory, design, and manufacturing functions to achieve greater economies. All these operations were integrated with the controller&#39;s office by the improved reporting and financial control systems.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Coordination between purchasing and manufacturing alone enabled the company to cut inventory costs by $750 million with a &quot;just in time&quot; inventory system and a reduced number of parts. For decades Chrysler&#39;s engineering department had been boosting production costs by the addition of sophisticated design elements the customer was unwilling to pay extra for. Now coordination between engineering and marketing helped produce economies such as the reduced transport costs for the K-cars achieved by limiting their length so that more of them could fit on a standard freight car.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The net result of this value-implementation program was a 23 percent reduction in fixed costs over five years and a reduction in the company&#39;s breakeven point from 2.3 million cars to 1.1 million.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Implementing Harmony Without</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">One of Iacocca&#39;s major objectives was to overcome Chrysler&#39;s loss of contact with the market, to re-establish harmony between what the engineers designed and what the market wanted, and to restore customer confidence in the quality of Chrysler cars and the stability of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">First he had to reverse a corporate habit of cutting new-product development funds whenever money became tight. At the height of Chrysler&#39;s financial crisis, he committed $700 million three years in advance to fund development of the highly successful minivan.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At the same time, he had to restore market confidence in the company and its products in order to ensure that they would even be around three years later. To restore public faith, the company engaged the advertising firm of Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt. Breaking all precedents in the industry, Chrysler established extremely close coordination with the ad agency, even allowing agency representatives to sit on the company&#39;s marketing and production-planning committees. Together they developed a series of newspaper advertisements that openly acknowledged all of Chrysler&#39;s problems and effectively communicated management&#39;s commitment to rectifying them. The words by themselves would not have inspired the market, but they were backed by a radically new policy (new for the industry&mdash;but which Sears had popularized 80 years before)&mdash;a 30-day money-back guarantee on the purchase of new Chrysler cars. The policy instilled faith where words alone could not. Sales soared, and less than 0.2 percent of the cars sold under the guarantee were returned.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Of course, advertisements and guarantees would have been of little value if the company&#39;s new K-car had not been what the market wanted. But under the pressure of a crisis, Chrysler&#39;s development engineers had uncharacteristically bent their ears to the market and heard correctly what it wanted. After his arrival Iacocca took personal charge to ensure that they continued to do so.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The right car was not enough. Chrysler&#39;s dealers had been mistreated by the company for years. Their cooperation was essential for elimination of the sales bank and restoration of customer confidence. The new management made a major effort to improve relations with the dealers, to listen to their grievances, assure them that quality would improve, and inform them of the internal changes taking place. At the same time it had to deal firmly with dealer discontent over abolition of the sales bank, which had been a continuous source of discount-priced cars for the dealers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The response of the market to these initiatives was remarkable, especially in view of the competition from Japan and the leveling of demand. In 1978 Chrysler sold 1.2 million passenger cars in the United States and the percentage of Chrysler car owners who intended to buy a Chrysler as their next car dropped to 36 percent, just half the 72 percent figure of GM. By 1984 volume had risen to 2 million cars.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In addition to the good design of the K-car and Iacocca&#39;s TV advertisements, there was another factor responsible for the improved market response. Energy attracts, and intense energy attracts powerfully. During the last five years, Chrysler has released an enormous amount of potential energy to ride out the crisis and spur recovery. That energy has not only wrought changes within the company; it has evoked a response from the market as well.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Twelve Steps</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler has not just survived a crisis. It has grown substantially and is a stronger company today than anytime in the recent past. Crises followed by growth are common enough in all fields of life. Growth depends on energy, and the effort made to survive a crisis often releases far greater energy than is required for ere survival. Crises generate an intense pressure that compels people and organizations to make greater efforts than they would otherwise be motivated to make left to themselves. As we saw in Chapter 1, regardless of whether it is generated externally by a crisis or an opportunity or internally by a determination to grow, the effort&mdash;if sufficient&mdash;energizes the organization and spurs its growth. The process of that growth is the same in all three cases.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We can identify all the major steps of that process in Iacocca&#39;s work at Chrysler. They are similar to the steps taken by our manager in Chapter 11 to become a significant individual.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. </span><span class="c2">Identify weaknesses and eliminate them</span><span class="c3">. Knowledge of imperfections and a willingness to remove them are a prerequisite to growth. Often it requires a crisis to motivate companies to such an effort. In Chrysler&#39;s case the problems were so deeply entrenched that only a crisis could generate sufficient pressure to overcome them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. </span><span class="c2">Decide on your values and goals</span><span class="c3">. Knowledge of one&#39;s weaknesses and problems is essential for remedial action, but knowledge becomes powerful only when it is accepted and endorsed by the will and converted into a decision to act. It is not enough to know what needs to be done. There must also be a resolute decision to do it. That decision releases energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">After understanding Chrysler&#39;s problems, Iacocca identified some of the essential corporate values necessary for its recovery and success: discipline first; then quality, economy, and efficiency; punctual product development; standardization and systemization; internal coordination and communication; cooperation with the union, dealers, and suppliers; integration of the company&#39;s operations around a central organizing and controlling executive team; harmony with market needs; and public confidence. His decision, in effect, was to do everything within his power and the company&#39;s resources to improve performance in all these areas.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. </span><span class="c2">Make a real commitment to change</span><span class="c3">. For the decision to influence others and enlist their cooperation, it had to be backed by a genuine personal commitment to achieve what had been decided. Since Iacocca was asking everyone else to sacrifice, he began by sacrificing his entire salary for a year. Since he was asking others to work harder, he committed himself to sacrifice personal leisure and comfort to see that the job was done. More than his words, that personal commitment persuaded others to leave secure jobs to join him at Chrysler and evoked the respect and cooperation of company employees.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. </span><span class="c2">Generate enthusiasm</span><span class="c3">. When people obey an order, they contribute their physical energy to the work. When they understand the importance of the work and decide it should be done, they lend their mental energies for its accomplishment. But when their emotions are aroused and they become enthused by the challenge and eager to accomplish it, the entire energies of their personalities are released and pour forth into the work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A task as onerous and difficult as Iacocca faced at Chrysler could never be accomplished by a grim or half-hearted determination. It demands a total commitment of energy and an enthusiastic effort. The most effective way to release enthusiasm in others is to be genuinely enthusiastic oneself. Because Iacocca really believed in what he was doing and really wanted his program to succeed, his full energies and enthusiasm were released. His enthusiasm spread to others, instilled confidence, released their energies, and enlivened the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. </span><span class="c2">Create the right structures</span><span class="c3">. Every value needs a structure for its implementation. Values without structures are like precious jewels without settings. You can keep them in a drawer, but cannot put them to any use. The structure may be one job position, a team, or a whole department. Iacocca created innumerable new structures and altered many existing ones to give greater form and force to the values he sought to implement. He restructured the engineering, manufacturing, marketing, purchasing, accounts payable, and controller functions. He established a new quality-control department. He also eliminated unproductive operations that were dragging the company down.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">6. </span><span class="c2">Set standards and establish rules</span><span class="c3">. Values cannot be properly implemented unless they are translated into specific standards of performance with respect to each and every aspect of work to which they apply. Standards must be supported by rules. Standards tell people what you want, but in many cases you have to tell them exactly how to do it, too&mdash;and, more important, how not to do it. Clear rules backed up by authority are critical to success.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca introduced higher standards in areas of operations such as discipline, product quality, efficiency, return on investment, time-liness, and worker productivity. New rules were formulated to define appropriate conduct, like the more stringent rules to reduce worker absenteeism.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">7. </span><span class="c2">Recruit the right people</span><span class="c3">. People are the real raw material of business. They are loaded with hidden talents, capacities, and unexpressed energy. Tapping that resource is like a free pass into Fort Knox.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca brought in several dozen talented and experienced people to constitute his new management team&mdash;people he felt he could trust. He also retired or fired almost the entire front line of existing executives, who had become entrenched in or habituated to the old ways of functioning and would find it difficult to adjust to radical change. He delved deeper into the organization and discovered a rich reserve of dynamic, young, talented people, &quot;people with fire in their eyes,&quot;</span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt176" id="ftnt_ref176">[176]</a></sup><span class="c3">&nbsp;raised them to the light of day, and gave them freedom and responsibility to express their capacities in their work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The true significance of Iacocca&#39;s accomplishment can be fully perceived only when it is realized how much of it was fashioned out of the company&#39;s existing resources&mdash;particularly its people&mdash;which the earlier management had not properly utilized.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">8. </span><span class="c2">Create systems for everything</span><span class="c3">. There is no business activity that cannot be reduced to a system. There is nothing a dynamic CEO or a skilled manager can do that cannot be done much better by a system. The enduring successes of IBM and GM are testimony to this truth. Every company has hundreds of systems, but that still covers only about 60 percent of their activities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca was shocked to find some key systems missing at Chrysler and many existing ones fallen into disuse, which amounts to the same thing. For every value he sought to implement, he introduced new systems or modified existing ones. A reporting system, financial controls, and systems for purchasing, inventory, product development, scheduling, sales, and quality control all had to be revamped and upgraded to achieve a higher level of value implementation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">9.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Train for every skill you need</span><span class="c3">. If you make a list of all the skills needed to do the job of a CEO effectively, the skills that can be acquired by training, it will come to more than 100. Every executive, every manager, indeed all the people in an organization need all these skills to be fully effective at their jobs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Chrysler Corporation had achieved its original prominence in engineering largely because of the Chrysler Institute, established by Walter Chrysler in 1930 to train automotive engineers. The institute supplied talented staff not only to Chrysler but to the entire industry.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Iacocca found that there were a lot of other people at Chrysler who needed training&mdash;training to meet quality standards and time schedules and to operate systems. For instance, a training program had to be instituted to teach the sales force how to use the new ordering system.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">10. </span><span class="c2">Make all the right connections</span><span class="c3">. A company is like an army. Unless you coordinate every activity and integrate every level, you end up firing on your own troops or starving them to death. The departments at Chrysler were doing both.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Improved coordination between engineering and production cut product-development time, reduced quality problems, and helped eliminate impractical designs before they reached the production phase. Similar gains were made by coordination between engineering and marketing and between production and purchasing, as well as between the company and other organizations, such as its and agency and suppliers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">11. </span><span class="c2">Communicate</span><span class="c3">. Disseminating factual information, sending clear messages, issuing clear instructions, listening to what others have to say, and spreading better understanding are necessary to ensure that the decisions made by top management are understood by those below and that the greatest possible measure of acceptance, commitment, and enthusiasm is evoked for their implementation. Ultimately, value implementation depends on the actions of the lowest level of workers in an organization. Communication is the means for creating awareness, willingness, and enthusiasm at that level.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">12. </span><span class="c2">Institutionalize the values</span><span class="c3">. The first 11 stages outlined above are steps that can be taken by management to release the energies of an organization, instill higher values, and utilize the energies to implement those values in work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In Chapter 3 we spoke of three further levels of value implementation that begin after the organized effort is completed. When the values become so deeply ingrained in the people and the organization that external systems of enforcement are made obsolete because appropriate conduct is enforced by peer pressure, then the values have become institutionalized as a part of the corporate milieu. At a later stage the values are accepted by the individuals in the company as an essential part of their jobs and are implemented even in the absence of peer pressure. They have become customs in the organization. Finally a stage can be reached when the individuals identify with the company&#39;s central values as personal values in their own lives. A mature corporate culture develops.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Institutionalizing Value Implementation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The transition from the first 11 steps to the three stages of the last step in value implementation usually takes a long time. But time is not the only thing necessary, for in many companies that transition is never made at all. There are other conditions. First, the active effort at value implementation through stages one to 11 must be fully completed, without the omission of any step. If any element is missing, the process does not mature; and it may even lose ground later on, as it has many times at Chrysler after a period of energetic effort and progress. Second, the effort at value implementation must itself become an institutionalized activity of the organization. It must become a conscious goal of the entire company, supported by the appropriate decisions, structure, systems, skills, and continuous, ongoing activities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">At Chrysler value implementation is still a personal activity of top management, compelled by the external pressure of a crisis situation, propelled by the dynamism and commitment of Iacocca and his staff, imposed on the organization by force of circumstances, managerial authority, and persuasion. How far these values have actually been accepted at lower levels of the company, how deeply the effort has penetrated the corporate character, and what will happen after the external pressure recedes and Iacocca retires remain to be seen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In spite of its size, Chrysler has always functioned more like a personal company than an impersonal organization. Walter Chrysler ran it like an old-time proprietor trained in a corner grocery store. Iacocca found it was still that way 60 years later. Observing the quick, personal decision-making process at Chrysler, </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;very recently commented that it is still run &quot;more like a corner grocery store&quot;&mdash;even today. </span><sup class="c3"><a href="#ftnt177" id="ftnt_ref177">[177]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">History shows that the Chrysler corporate personality strongly resists change except in times of crisis, and that corporate personality remains largely intact. Unless that personality is changed at its core, and unless that change is carried down into the smallest acts and attitudes of the company, sooner or later the old personality will reassert itself and the old problems will re-emerge.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Process of Development</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The revival of Chrysler is a remarkable achievement, but it still remains a revival, not a transformation. That achievement follows a process&mdash;the same process that enabled Bata to emerge from the risis of 1922 and grow into a multinational corporation, the same process that enabled Marriott to take advantage of the opportunities presented by an increasingly mobile American public and convert a local group of Hot Shoppes into a worldwide chain of hotels. This is the same process that enabled Apple, Coca-Cola, Delta, General Mills, IBM, Merck, Northwestern Mutual, Sears, and so many others to rise from tiny origins, grow and grow, multiply and expand in a movement of corporate development that need never end.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In Chrysler and most or perhaps all of the others, the process is only partially conscious. It is largely directed by common sense, life experience, and trial and error. It is haphazard, fraught with omissions and false starts, subject to considerable delays&mdash;though everyone will gladly acknowledge that Iacocca took a remarkably short time to accomplish his task at Chrysler. This means that the process can generate even greater results, more quickly and with a less taxing effort, if it is fully understood and implemented systematically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The science of management has developed many powerful tools and techniques for increasing the productive efficiency of an organization. To be efficient is to fully utilize the available resources. But today many corporations are no longer preoccupied with problems of efficiency. They have mastered the skills and techniques for smooth organizational functioning and are searching for ways to accelerate the pace of growth. What they need are not more efficient operational tools but more powerful energizing processes for continuous expansion and rapid development.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In this chapter we have looked at the process by which the activities of a corporation are energized for growth. In the previous chapter we looked at the same process with respect to individuals, how their lives and work can be energized and made an occasion for personal growth. Both are expressions of the same process. Not only individuals and corporations but every single action they undertake can also be energized.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Individuals become significant by identifying themselves with the values and interests of the organization and serving the organization through the work. That work becomes a field for their personal growth. They grow by giving. Corporations achieve enduring success by identifying themselves with the values and needs of the society and serving the society through their work. That work becomes a field for corporate development. They grow by giving, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the same way, every action and activity performed by an individual or a corporation is an opportunity for growth, provided it is approached in the right way. Every act can be done either in a sub-standard manner or in an efficient manner or in a way that energizes and generates growth. The key is to approach the act from a wider perspective.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When C. E. Woolman decided to leave a Delta flight so that one more passenger could have a seat, he was not just being polite. He was sending a signal to everyone in the entire organization to look at their work from the customer&#39;s point of view. The Delta flight attendants who today share their food with hungry passengers are acting as Woolman did&mdash;thinking of the customer first. As a result, many airline passengers are constantly thinking of Delta, too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When Woodruff encouraged a policy of trying to provide the maximum profits to Coca-Cola bottlers, he was viewing his work from their point of view. The bottlers not only earned enormous profits; they were also energized to spread Coke to the distant corners of the world and send home untold wealth to the parent company. Woolman&#39;s was a small, insignificant symbolic act. Woodruff&#39;s was a lifetime policy. They both had a similar effect.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the Northwestern Mutual agent tries to find a way to help a policy owner whose policy has lapsed, when a Sears manager exchanges five-year-old Craftsman hand tools with a smile, when a Merck representative spells out the negative qualities of the firm&#39;s newest product, when a young General Mills product manager is given exceptional freedom to plan out an advertising campaign for Cheerios, when a Du Pont gate guard reminds departing drivers to buckle their seat belts&mdash;these are all tiny, insignificant acts carried out by looking at things from another person&#39;s point of view. They may be tiny, but they are incredibly powerful acts, energizing acts.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In every company there are hundreds of functions&mdash;replying to a letter, cleaning a machine, answering a phone, addressing a subordinate, meeting a customer, making a product, paying a bill, arranging a purchase. Each and every one of them can be done in a substandard or efficient or energizing way. Sears has energized purchasing by identifying with the interests of its suppliers. Apple has energized its people by giving them maximum freedom for self-expression.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Energizing the Corporation</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All the components of a company&mdash;people, organization, technology, markets, and money&mdash;can be energized in this way. When a manager focuses on getting work done through people, that manager acts efficiently. When a manager concentrates on relating to the people as individuals through their work and trying to foster their personal growth, that manager is energizing them (and, incidentally, raising efficiency to peak levels). Attention to people is an expansive movement that releases their energies and potentials and stimulates corporate growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When an organization is structured to carry out each separate task systematically, it is efficient. When it views each task as part of a greater whole and coordinates it with all other related activities, those activities are energized. Creation of smooth, harmonious interrelationships is an expansive movement for the activities and the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When technology is evaluated in terms of its design and productivity, more efficient technology is developed. When it is viewed in terms of the needs of the market and continuously refined to improve customer satisfaction, the vast potentials of technology reveal themselves. Looking at technology from the customers&#39; point of view is an expansive movement that energizes the corporation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When an intensive and comprehensive effort is made to exploit every conceivable means to increase sales of a product, the market for that product is efficiently utilized. When every effort is made to understand the needs of the society and serve those needs by providing a product or service, the market is energized. Serving the society through the market is an expansive movement that unleashes enormous energy and opens the way for unlimited growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When money is properly utilized and carefully accounted for in order to minimize wastage and maximize profits, it is used efficiently. When money is viewed as a measure or index of corporate development rather than as the ultimate goal to be pursued, money has a great power to energize the organization. Working for the development of the company utilizing money as a tool or an index is an expansive movement that generates the maximum growth and the maximum profits in the long term.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Relating to people through work in order to help them grow rather than to take more from them; coordinating and integrating all the activities and systems of an organization; viewing technology from the customers&#39; point of view; working for the benefit of suppliers, distributors, customers, and society at large; using profits as an index of growth rather than a goal&mdash;these are all expansive movements that release latent energies and potentials.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Conversion of Energy into Power</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The growth of a corporation, like the growth of an individual, depends on the continuous release, transmission, and conversion of fresh energies into work. The energy has to be generated and released, mastered and harnessed, directed and controlled, and transformed into productive power.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process begins with the generation of fresh energy. The generation of electrical enegy in physics depends on the creation of a voltage differential between two points. The greater the differential, the greater the energy generated. The same principle applies to an organization. Here the differential is created between where the company is now and where it wants to go, between the values and goals it is committed to achieve and its present level of performance. The higher the values and goals that are genuinely accepted, the greater is the energy released. Profit is a very limited goal, which can inspire only top-level executives. The psychological values listed in Chapters 3 and 11&mdash;harmony, personal growth, service, and so on&mdash;are ones that can inspire and release the maximum energy from all the people in the organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The energy released has to be transmitted through the structure and systems of the organization. The will of the organizational character acts like a relay or booster station. The systems are the transmission lines. The efficiency and speed of transmission depend on the extent to which organizational values like discipline, coordination, and teamwork are present. Without these values, the energy released is not properly directed, controlled, and utilized. It is dissipated in unproductive friction or wasted in uncoordinated activity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The energy released and transmitted has to be converted into action by people and machines. The amount of electrical energy that a bulb converts into light is limited by the wattage of the bulb, no matter how high the voltage is in the line. The conversion of energy into work in an organization is limited by the skills and attitudes of the people and the condition of all the elements of the corporate body. The greater the skills in the organization and the higher the level of physical value implementation&mdash;cleanliness, punctuality, maintenance, quality, efficiency&mdash;the greater the energy that is converted into work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Each time any value is raised to a higher level, greater energy is released, transmitted, or converted by the organization. That energy can be used to build up all the parts of the corporate personality and establish a new harmony at a higher level. As the corporation grows, the level of energy continues to increase, and more and more of it is institutionalized as the intensity of the corporate personality. That constant conversion of fresh energy into greater intensity infuses life into the organizations and makes it come alive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Every company adopts certain values that it recognizes as important and seeks to implement. As we have tried to illustrate through the examples from successful American companies, there is really no limit to the scope for implementing each value. Training at IBM, systems at Marriott, safety at Du Pont, teamwork at Northwestern Mutual, family feeling at Delta are all taken to a level far beyond that even conceived of by most companies. But there are many values, not just one or two, that can be raised to these peak levels, so that even the biggest and the best have an infinite scope for further growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When an individual succeeds in life, often that individual and other people are unaware of the process by which that success was accomplished. The same is true when people fail. We usually ascribe success to either talent, luck, or efficiency and failure to one of their opposites. But always there is a process behind them that we overlook.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.kdvtmidlehyf"><span class="c3">The process that Iacocca followed at Chrysler is the process by which all companies evolve, consciously or unconsciously. When knowledge of the process is fully conscious and complete, the process can be vastly accelerated and infinitely extended. It can be reduced to a program and converted into a specific action plan for implementation by any company.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h1 class="c24"><span class="c15 c37">Chapter 13 - The Vital Difference</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The greatest strength of this country has always been the freedom and opportunity it provides to all its citizens to rise in life as high as their aspirations and effort can carry them. During the early decades of American history, this strength remained largely in potential, conceded in principle for all but recognized as a real possibility only for a minority and actually realized in their own lives by just a few individuals who possessed some exceptional talent or made an extraordinary effort. There were very few Thomas Edisons, Andrew Carnegies, and Henry Fords even a hundred years ago.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But this is no longer true. Today the possibility of unlimited achievement has become real in the minds of most Americans, a fervent aspiration in the hearts of many, and an actual realization in the lives of a significant number. The highest levels of education, social status, political power, and commercial achievement have been attained by thousands and tens of thousands of people whose ancestors immigrated to the shores of America a century or less ago, outcast, impoverished, and illiterate. Today there are more highly educated people in every small town than most states contained a hundred years ago. In 1870 only one doctoral degree was conferred in the entire United States. In 1970 more than 29,000 were conferred. Today there are more important and influential people in every major city than the entire nation once contained. The number of M.D.&#39;s has increased nearly 6-fold in the last century and the number of dentists 15-fold. From 1900 to 1970 the number of engineers increased 40-fold. Many companies have made almost as many millionaires in the last few decades as the whole nation produced during the entire nineteenth century. Apple has traversed the ground between a garage-scale operation and a multi-billion-dollar corporation in 8 years, arriving in the exclusive </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;500 club faster than any company before it and making more than a hundred of its employees millionaires in the process. Tandem Computers, Inc. produced at least 25 millionaires while climbing to the </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;list in just a decade. Nor are the achievements confined to electronics. Federal Express grew from nothing to a $1.4 billion business in just 13 years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">All this goes to show one thing: Opportunities in every field are greater today than ever before. And if we still persist in being more conscious of the obstacles than we are of the potentials, it only reflects the limitations imposed by our vision and our attitude, not the actual limitations to our growth. At the turn of the century, there were about 50 major corporations in the United States. Today </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;lists 500. In another 50 years, there may be 5,000 or even 50,000. There is no inherent bar to growth, because growth is creative. It creates new opportunities, new technologies, new markets, and new wealth, which support further growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Apart from statistics, there are other facts right before our eyes that we usually ignore. When a market is expanding, many companies prosper, but not all. Those that fail in a buoyant market are labeled incompetent or unfortunate. When a market is shrinking, many companies fail, but not all. Those that survive in a period of declining market are labeled efficient or lucky. But what about companies like IBM, Sears, Delta, Marriott, Northwestern Mutual, and General Mills, which have not only survived during harsh times but continued to expand? All our labels prove inadequate. We can dismiss as luck a company&#39;s growth through one or two troublesome periods for its industry or the economy as a whole. But we cannot explain away the fact that of the top ten companies on </span><span class="c2">Fortune</span><span class="c3">&#39;s most admired list in 1984, only one of them ever reported an unprofitable year, and that was way back in 1921. Where we cannot attribute someone else&#39;s success to luck, our next recourse is to concede that it was accomplished by people of extraordinary genius or talent. We have been at pains to show, as Edison said, that genius is mainly a question of hard work.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Still it is very difficult to conceive that those individuals and companies that have achieved phenomenal success and multiplied it thousands of times over decades do not possess something extraordinary. And, in fact, they do. It is not an extraordinary ability, it is an extraordinary knowledge. In some, that knowledge is partially or completely unconscious. It is expressed as a feeling or a hunch or strikes them as just plain common sense. But if you closely observe the lives of America&#39;s most successful corporations and do not get caught up in their words and strategies and explanations, you will find that their success falls into a pattern and follows the process that we have described in this book.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Development of Corporate Personality</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Energy is converted by an organization into products and services for customers, welfare and well-being for employees, profit for shareholders, and service to the national economy or the society at large. Profit is the easiest of these results to measure, and therefore, it is the clearest index of corporate success. But actually, successful companies tend to produce all of these results in far greater measure than average companies do. In Chapter 3 we quoted statistics to show that this is true even of their contribution to society.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But these are not the only expressions of energy in a company. Energy can be converted into short-term material results. It can also be invested and absorbed by the organization for its own development, for the growth of its personality and capacities, just as an enormous amount of energy is absorbed and invested in the development of a child&#39;s body and mind.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We recognize that the primary purpose of childhood is for the child to grow and to develop its personality, not to achieve any immediate success in life. All its achievements later in life depend on and are limited by that early development. Even after the body is full-grown, we recognize the importance of a continuing investment of energy to increase one&#39;s knowledge and skills. When you stop growing, you start dying. Yet in the lives of companies, we focus on material results from day one and usually neglect the most critical task of all&mdash;the development of the powers and capacities of the corporate personality. Ultimately it is the strength and capacities of that personality that set the limits on corporate achievement. For sustained corporate success, there must be an ongoing and continuous effort at corporate self-development.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">And the force and consistency of that effort, through the years and through the generations, is what makes the vital difference between companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">A corporation grows as its personality develops. The development of corporate personality involves two movements&mdash;the release of latent energies from the components of the company and the conversion of that energy into productive power.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In companies with a well-developed corporate personality, energies are released by the psychic center when it takes an expansive attitude or adopts higher values for implementation. Once the energy is released, the psychic center sets the direction for the conversion of those energies into productive power by the rest of the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">But not every company has a mature personality, and no company begins its life with one. Personality has to develop over time. In the early stages, the release of energy and its conversion into power through value implementation are done by the founder or a dynamic CEO, who lends his or her own personality to the corporation for its development. The founder or CEO taps the potentials of people, organization, technology, the market, and capital and utilizes the energy they contain to raise the level of value implementation in the company and launch it on a period of rapid growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The decision to adopt a higher value and implement it requires enormous energy. Therefore, energy is an essential prerequisite for value implementation. On the other hand, the adoption of higher values also releases energy, and the implementation of these values harnesses the enormous latent potentials of the company for its growth.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">The Process</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The release of energy from the components, the implementation of higher values, and the development of the corporate personality are actually three inseparable aspects of a single process, which occur simultaneously and complement one another.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When raw energy is generated and released, controlled and disciplined, organized and refined, harnessed and utilized for the development of the corporate personality, it is converted into organizational power. When sufficient power collects and is gathered, focused, and directed for the translation of high corporate values into physical practices, that power is expressed as a solid mass of radiating intensity like that observed in mature, highly successful companies. The constant conversion of energy into intensity for the continuous development of the corporate personality and the perfection of all its activities is the process that generates sustained corporate success. That process has been described previously in this book. It consists of movement in two directions: from action to ideal and from ideal to action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In every action, we release and express energy. By giving greater attention and concentration to each action, we execute it more perfectly. The energy is upgraded into skill. Each single skilled movement is only one link in a series of actions. By systematically linking skilled actions with the proper timing and sequence, the activity can be accomplished far more efficiently. The skilled acts are combined to form systems. Isolated systems of skilled activity can be coordinated and integrated with other activities to form an organized and unified whole. Systems are united to create an organization. This mass of interrelated and interconnected systematic activities needs to be controlled, coordinated, and directed from a common center. As an organization becomes more integrated and unified, it develops a psychic center, which determines its direction and guides all its activities. The upward movement from raw energy to skilled action to systematic activities to coordinated and integrated organization to creation of a psychic center is the process by which personality develops through action.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process also moves in the other direction. The ideal values or goals of the psychic center are transmitted down through the organization to be expressed as more perfect actions. The psychic center accepts a new value or goal, or it increases its commitment to the values and goals it has previously accepted. It translates that commitment into an enthusiastic determination to upgrade its own performance. It then creates new organizational structures, standards, rules, and systems to achieve higher performance on the value; or it upgrades existing structures, standards, rules, and systems to the level required. It acquires new or improved skills that are necessary. Finally it expresses its higher level of commitment, organizational capacity, and skill as improved physical performance&mdash;better-quality products or technology, faster service, cleaner facilities, better-maintained equipment, and so on. The results of this process are higher sales and profits, more satisfied customers and employees, and a contribution to the economic or social development of the nation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The entire process can be reduced to five key ingredients:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. A committed management and skilled, enthusiastic staff.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. A systematic and coordinated organization.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. Superior technology and quality products.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. A harmonious relationship with the market.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. Optimal and creative utilization of financial resources</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When any of these components is raised to a higher level, it is as a result of the process described above, even though a company may not conceive of it in these terms when it acts. The growth of any one component increases the overall capacity of the corporate personality; but unidimensional development of one part can have only limited benefit for the whole. Growth must be balanced and harmonious in order to be continuous and yield maximum results.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By raising the other components up to restore harmony with the fastest-growing part, the organization expands in capacity and grows even further. By continuously adopting higher levels of value implementation as the goal and following the steps outlined in Chapter 12, each part can be continuously raised higher. More and more energy is generated, transmitted, and converted by the corporation, producing greater material results and greater growth of the corporate personality. When the process is continuously followed, endless expansion and enduring success are the inevitable result.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Converting the Process into a Method</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The process we have described here with reference to the development of corporations is the same process by which individuals and societies grow and evolve. It is the process of human development. This process occurs spontaneously, inevitably, and irresistibly whenever the essential conditions for it are met, just like a chemical reaction. But normally the development of personality is slow, sporadic, and partial, because all the essential conditions for growth are not always present or not present in the proper proportions and combinations or not blended together in the proper manner by force of circumstances.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In other words, the process occurs unconsciously and incompletely. Some energy is released by external conditions&mdash;crises and opportunities. Some values are implemented partially and haphazardly by force of necessity or to improve performance. As a result, the organization moves forward, bounds upward to a higher level, and again levels off.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This is the process by which the corporate personality evolves naturally and unconsciously. It is a process initiated from outside, which results in an inner growth. But the same process can also be consciously initiated. It can be initiated from within by the psychic center to the degree that the psychic center is developed and is conscious of the process. This is what happens to some extent in mature companies like Northwestern Mutual when they set for themselves a greater challenge in the absence of compelling outer circumstances. The process leads to growth of the company and further development of the corporate personality.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">When the process becomes fully conscious and is consciously implemented, it is converted into a method for continuous development of the corporate personality and expansion of the company. Since the conscious method is more complete than the unconscious process, the growth is greater and more rapid.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In the early stages of corporate evolution, the psychic center is not developed enough to consciously initiate this process on its own. It can only respond to external events. But a founder or CEO with a developed personality can lend a personality to the company and initiate the process of growth to the extent that the CEO knows it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For growth to become a permanent and enduring feature in the life of an organization, this process must be institutionalized. What has been done at times by the founder or a CEO must become a permanent activity of the psychic center, continuously releasing and converting energy for endless expansion and enduring success.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Where to Begin</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This process can be utilized by every company. How the process is utilized depends on where you want to go and how serious you are about getting there. It depends on your goal and your willingness to make the effort required to achieve it. Though the process is relatively simple, the effort is arduous&mdash;it is in direct proportion to the height of the goal. A tenfold expansion requires a tenfold greater effort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">No hardworking person is suddenly capable of a tenfold greater effort than before. But all are capable of improving the quality and quantity of their effort to 100 percent of their capacity and sustaining it at that peak level </span><span class="c2">if they really want to</span><span class="c3">. The effort to achieve and maintain performance at peak capacity releases, not tenfold, but a hundredfold greater energy over time. The key is to fully exhaust the present capacity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Long-Term Goal</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For those who are willing to make that total effort, there is no limit to the goals they can achieve, no end to their expansion. But there are several preconditions for that effort.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Choose your goal</span><span class="c3">. The decision must be complete, the commitment total, the willingness enthusiastic.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Know what it involves</span><span class="c3">. You must conceive of the amount of effort required to achieve the goal and be willing to make it. You must recognize all the skills needed to realize the goal and be ready to acquire them. You must understand the type of organization demanded for that higher level of functioning and be ready to create it. You must be aware of the higher level of motivated staff the achievement demands and be willing to raise people&#39;s enthusiasm to that level. You must know the values that can help you realize the goal and enthusiastically accept them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Learn the process</span><span class="c3">. Growth is usually achieved without understanding. Understanding comes later. But when knowledge of the process precedes experience, the process is far easier, and the progress is much more rapid. The process has to be conceived in practical terms, as it has been described in Chapter 12.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Work happily to achieve it</span><span class="c3">. Growth is fastest, easiest, and greatest when the effort is made happily and wholeheartedly. High results are hard to achieve with a grudging or complaining attitude. The effort itself should become self-fulfilling and self-rewarding.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Implement comprehensive strategies</span><span class="c3">. To achieve your highest goal, implement as many of the following strategies as you can. The more you implement, the faster and farther the growth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. The CEO should endeavor to become a significant individual.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. Encourage every manager to become a significant individual.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">3. Implement all the corporate values completely in every department and activity of the company.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">4. Create and implement a plan for maximum development of all the potentials of people, organization, technology, market, and capital.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">5. Upgrade all substandard operations to the level of maximum efficiency and energize all efficient operations, so that performance on every one of the company&#39;s 500 to 1,000 functions is improved in some measure.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">6. List all the functions of the company and arrange them in a hierarchy of levels. Place each function in its proper order of sequence and identify all the other functions with which it should be coordinated or integrated in order for operations to be perfectly harmonious. Using this list as a goal and the present operations as a starting point, work out a step-by-step action plan for increasing the level of coordination and harmony at all points.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">7. Identify the highest multiple of growth that you believe the company is capable of achieving and you are willing to work for. Draw up a detailed plan of how the company would be constituted and function if that goal were achieved. Compare that plan with the company&#39;s existing level of functioning. Work out an action plan to bridge the gap between the two.</span></p><p class="c4 c30"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Short-Term Goal</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Not every company is in a position to make a comprehensive effort for growth at a particular point in time. If conditions do not permit implementation of comprehensive strategies, the same method can still be utilized to double a company&#39;s present level of profits. Partial strategies such as the following should be considered:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">1. Take any one value and implement it to the highest level of perfection conceivable in every single aspect of the company&#39;s functioning, as Du Pont has implemented safety and Marriott has implemented systems.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">2. Or take every corporate value listed in Chapter 3 and increase the company&#39;s level of performance on each one by 5 percent to 10 percent.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c7">Small Steps Leading to Great Results</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">For immediate gains that are disproportionate to the effort required, implement as many of these isolated strategies as possible:</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">1. Increase slightly the level of attention given to people at all levels.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">2. Improve slightly the quality of products and/or raw materials.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">3. Raise the average level of education in recruitment.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">4. Impart one new skill to each manager and worker.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">5. Improve coordination of two major systems or coordinate all systems that relate to a single activity.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c3">6. Offer incentives for continuing education or training, innovation in technology, innovation in office or production procedures, and/or greater knowledge of the market.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">For All</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Some things are good in themselves, regardless of whether or not they are expressed; knowledge is one of them. We believe that even an understanding of the process described in this book can make an individual a better manager and a corporation a better company.</span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Infinite Potential</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">There is an inexhaustible potential within the organization. It is inexhaustible because the more it is drawn from, the greater it grows. The more enthusiastically it is tapped, the more it increases at its source. The more it is enjoyed, the more it expands.</span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c3">People and companies have grown to where they are&mdash;and they continue to develop&mdash;by drawing from this boundless potential. Those who have used this potential to unleash the powers of sustained corporate success have learned how to make a vital difference, in their lives and in the lives of their organizations. The first qualification is to want it. The more you want it, the more you grow. The more conscious you become of it, the more it beckons you to further growth. That is the essential message of this book.</span></p><hr class="c50"><div><p class="c61"><a href="#ftnt_ref1" id="ftnt1">[1]</a><span class="c62 c15 c37">CHAPTER 1</span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c9">.
